    Creating content is a complex business. 

    * You have to research your subject matter and your audience. 

    * You have to figure out what needs to be said and how to say it to achieve your desired effect. 

    * You then have to record the content, manage it, and publish it, potentially to many different audiences and many different media. 

    * If you are part of an organization that creates a lot of content, you have to coordinate what you are doing with what everyone else in doing and make sure it all works together and serves the organization's goals. 

    * You have to create good consistent letter shapes with your pen. 

    Okay, we haven't had to deal with that last one for a few centuries now. But something has to create all those letter shapes consistently, line the up nicely, and fit them between the margins. Before we had machines to do it for us, that task was part of the writer's life, and an essential skill if you wanted to create a readable document. And if you wanted more than one copy, you had to write out each copy by hand, or hire some copyists to do it for you.

    Fortunately, Guttenberg invented a machine that took that burden off the writer's hands. This made the writer's life easier. It allowed people who were not trained in caligraphy to become writers. It also put a lot of copyists out of business. (Yes, the loss of white-collar jobs to automation is not a new thing.) Of course, it made the making of books so much cheapter that it revolutionized a civilization. 

    What the printing press did was to partition the complexity of making books, partitioning the task of composition from the task of book making. Of course, the writer's handwriting still had to be good enough for the printer to read. Then came the typewriter, and now many children are not even being taught cursive writing in school. Lament the withering of the skill if you like, but it represents a new partitioning of the writing process, one in which the physical manipulation of the pen, and the shaping of letters, has been entirely partitioned from the writer, who is now expected to compose on a keyboard. 

    Of course, this introduces a new skill that the writer has to master: typing. When a task is partitioned, there is always a new skill to learn. The reason is that you need to transmit information from one partition to another. The typewriter (or, today, the computer and monitor) have taken over the task of forming letters on paper or screen, but they need to know which letters you want to appear. You tell them by tapping keys on the keyboard. The keys are and interface between the partitions of the writing process. Using the new interfaces is part of the adaptation to working in the new partitioned system. 

    There are usually two benefits to partitioning the content process. The first is that that it makes the writer's job easier, meaning that more people can write and the more of the writer's attention can be on their subject matter and the words they choose to express it, and less on their tools. The second is that the part of the task that has been partitioned off can often be performed better and more efficiently by the person or process whose job it becomes. A typewriter or a computer makes much more consistent letter shapes than a human hand. The printing press makes identical copies much faster than a human copyist. 

    Each of these things are complex tasks in themselves and they become all the more complex when you have to coordinate them all. Not everyone has the skills or the knowledge to do all these things well, and if too much of the complexity falls on one person's shoulders, it will limit their ability to perform well or deliver on time. In particular, writing well is an activity that requires the whole of the writer's attention. Any part of the complexity of the content creation process that divides the writer's attention makes it more difficult for them to write quality content. 
    
    You can't reduce the fundamental complexity of content creation. All that stuff has to get done, and it is all difficult in one way or another. All you can do is to make sure that the inherent complexity is handled by the people or processes that are best equipped to deal with it. Managing a content creation process is all about partitioning and distributing the complexity of content creation in the right way. 
    
    Every content organization practices the partitioning and distribution of content creation. Newspapers do not make reporters drive the delivery trucks. Publishing houses do not let authors design book covers (much as they might want to). Recognizing that spotting your own mistakes is difficult, wise organizations partition the job of editing and proofreading content from the job of writing it. 
    
    What happens if the inherent complexity of content creation is not managed properly? Complexity cannot be destroyed, so it has to go somewhere. If no one in the publishing organization handles it, it falls through to the reader. If a piece of content is missing information the reader needs, then the burden of finding the missing information falls on the reader. If the reader can't understand the terms used, or read the font chosen, or find content to explain an unfamiliar concept, or get the information they need when they need it, or tell current information from outdated, that is complexity falling through the content creation process to land on the reader's head. The reader must then either handle the complexity themselves or abandon the content. 
    
    Another name for this is poor quality content. Poor quality content is the direct result of the complexity of content creation falling through to reader instead of being handled in the organization that produced it. The way for an organization to consistently create quality content is to make sure that every piece of the inherent complexity of content creation is directed to a competent and adequately resourced person or process so that none of it falls through to the reader. 
    
        
    
    Structured writing offers a different way to partition and distribute the complexity of content creation and delivery that better address the modern content creation challenge. The fundamentals of these techniques are not new. In fact, they all exist in the desktop publishing paradigm. When we define a stylesheet in {FrameMaker}. When we use CSS to separate formatting from our HTML content, we are using structured writing techniques. What we call structured writing today is simply about taking those techniques one or two steps further to allow us to better partition and distribute all of the complexity of content creation in or organizations. 
    
    Alas, not every structured writing system does a good job of distributing complexity appropriately for every organization. Many merely move it from the shoulders of one group to the shoulders of another without regard to whether those shoulders are broad enough to bear the additional burden. Far too often, content management installations are designed and implemented with an eye to solving one part of the content management complexity, rather than with an eye to how content complexity is distributed and handled throughout your whole content system. Tools and systems designed for one purpose are almost always careless about where they deflect the complexity they don't handle. In many cases, while they take the pressure off one group or function, they add to the total amount of unhandled complexity in the system. This is a big part of why so many content management systems fail and so many organizations hate their content management system. 

    
    This book seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of how different structured writing techniques can be used to partition and distribute the complexity of content creation. It does not advocate for any one system. Nor will it tell you exactly which combination of techniques and tools will be right for your organization. Different organizations have different kinds of complexity to deal with and need to distribute it in different ways to maximize the quality of the content they produce. Finding the right combination of techniques for your organization is up to you. Hopefully, though, this book will give your the information you need to figure out what will work best, whether that means adopting or adapting an existing system or building all or part of a system for yourself.   
    
    Most content systems have never  seriously attempted to minimize the amount of complexity they dump on the reader. Quality and process have largely been treated as separate concerns, as if the process and its demands had no influence, for good or bad, on the quality of content that writers produced. 
    
    The idea that you can build quality into a process by managing the complexity of the design and production process, though well accepted in other fields, has not been widely considered in content. To a large extent, where we have sought process improvements, they have been in the areas of publishing and content management, not in content itself. Where structured writing tools have replaced desktop publishing or word processing tools it has largely been for process goals. But a more holistic view would show that process and quality are intimately related, and the treating them holistically can significantly improve both.
