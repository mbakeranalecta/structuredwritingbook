    Creating content is a complex business. 

    * You have to research your subject matter and your audience. 

    * You have to figure out what needs to be said and how to say it to achieve your desired effect. 

    * You then have to record the content, manage it, and publish it, potentially to many different audiences and many different media. 

    * If you are part of an organization that creates a lot of content, you have to coordinate what you are doing with what everyone else in doing and make sure it all works together and serves the organization's goals. 

    * As your subject matter and your business needs change over time, you need to figure out how your content needs to change and implement all those changes cleanly and efficiently. 

    * You have to create good consistent letter shapes with your pen. 

    Okay, we haven't had to deal with that last one for a while now. But something has to create letter shapes, line them up nicely, and fit them between the margins. Before we had machines to do it for us, that task was part of the writer's life, and an essential skill if you wanted to create a readable document. And if you wanted more than one copy, you had to write out each copy by hand, or hire some copyists to do it for you.

    Fortunately, Gutenberg invented a machine that took that burden off the writer's hands. This made the writer's life easier. It allowed people who were not trained in calligraphy to become writers. It also put a lot of copyists out of business. (Yes, the loss of white-collar jobs to automation is not a new thing.) It also made the making of books so much cheaper that it revolutionized a civilization. 

    What the printing press did was to partition partitioning the task of language composition from the task of physical book making. Of course, the writer's handwriting still had to be good enough for the printer to read. But then came the typewriter, and now many children are not even being taught cursive writing in school. Lament the withering of the skill if you like, but it represents a new partitioning of the writing process, one in which the physical manipulation of the pen, and the shaping of letters, has been entirely partitioned from the writer, who is now expected to compose on a keyboard. 

    Of course, this introduces a new skill that the writer has to master: typing. When a task is partitioned, there is always a new skill to learn. Partitioning a task creates the need to transmit information from one partition to another. The typewriter (or, today, the computer and monitor) take over the task of forming letters on paper or screen, but they need to know which letters you want to appear. You tell them by tapping keys on the keyboard. The keys are the interface between the partitions of the writing process. Using the new interfaces is part of the adaptation to working in the newly partitioned system. 

    Of course, there is far more to the total content development and delivery process than forming consistent letter shapes and making copies quickly. Every content organization practices the partitioning and distribution of content creation. Newspapers do not make reporters drive the delivery trucks. Publishing houses do not let authors design book covers (much as they might want to). Recognizing that spotting your own mistakes is difficult, wise organizations partition the job of editing and proofreading content from the job of writing it. When they need to orchestrate a large body of content to the Web, organizations employ information architects and content strategists. All of these are examples of partitioning the complexity of the content process with the goal of improving quality and efficiency. The partitioning of a modern content process is complex, often involving multiple partitions with multiple complex interfaces. 

    There are two potential benefits to partitioning the content process. The first is that it can make the writer's job easier, meaning that more people can write and the more of the writer's attention can be on their subject matter and the words they choose to express it, and less on their tools. The second is that it can make the part of the task that has been partitioned off faster and more efficient by directing it to a person or process better equipped to handle it. A typewriter or a computer makes much more consistent letter shapes than a human hand. The printing press makes identical copies much faster than a human copyist. 

    Unfortunately, these two benefits do not always go hand in hand. In some cases, organizations looking to make a particular process more efficient partition the system in a way that makes the writing task more complex rather than less. Or in an attempt to make writing simpler, they partition the system in a way that makes editing, publishing, or content management more difficult. 

    You can't reduce the fundamental complexity of content creation. All that stuff has to get done, and it is all difficult in one way or another. Different tasks require different skills and knowledge. You can't just dump it all on the writer and hope it will all work out. The writing task alone -- figuring out what to say and how best to say it -- is a complex task that deserves the writer's whole attention. You cannot eliminate the complexity of everything that goes on around the writing task, but you can make sure that it is partitioned and directed to people or processes that are best equipped to deal with it. 
    
    What happens if the inherent complexity of content creation is not managed properly? Complexity cannot be destroyed. It has to go somewhere. If no one in the publishing organization handles it, it falls through to the reader. If a piece of content is missing information the reader needs, then the burden of finding the missing information falls on the reader. If the reader can't understand the terms used, or read the font chosen, or find content to explain an unfamiliar concept, or get the information they need when they need it, or tell current information from outdated, that is complexity falling through the content creation process to land on the reader's head. The reader must then either handle the complexity themselves or abandon the content. 
    
    Another name for this is poor quality content. Poor content quality is the direct result of the complexity of content creation falling through to the reader instead of being handled in the organization that produced it. The way for an organization to consistently create quality content is to make sure that every piece of the inherent complexity of content creation is directed to a competent and adequately resourced person or process so that none of it falls through to the reader. But this is not always easy to do.  

    The interfaces to the writing process have been based on the desktop publishing or word processing models for a few decades now, and these tools have become ever more complex as the complexity of content processes have become more complex, particularly since the advent of the web. Often when we have an established partitioning in place, and have built our processes and our teams around that partitioning, the way we react to new demands and new complexity is to leave the existing partitioning in place and add additional complexity to each of the existing partitions and their interfaces. There is a limit to how long such a process is sustainable before the complexity overwhelms the existing structures and begins to fall through to the reader as poor quality content. Many organizations are well past that point today, and content quality and process efficiency are compromised as a result. A new approach to content creation is needed, one that does more that simply swap one tool for another in the current partitioning of the content system, but which fundamentally alters how the content system is partitioned, restoring simplicity to authors while improving the efficiency and reliability of the related processes. 
    
    Structured writing offers a different way to partition and distribute the complexity of content creation and delivery. Designed and implemented correctly, it can better address the modern content creation challenge. 

    Alas, many of the structured writing systems available today, and many of the implementations of such tools, don't really repartition existing content system. Others may change the partitioning without making it work for everyone, they merely move it from the shoulders of one group to the shoulders of another without regard to whether those shoulders are broad enough to bear the additional burden. 

    Far too often, content management installations are designed and implemented with an eye to solving one part of the content management complexity, rather than with an eye to how content complexity is distributed and handled throughout your whole content system. Tools and systems designed for one purpose are almost always careless about where they deflect the complexity they don't handle. In many cases, while they take the pressure off one group or function, they add to the total amount of unhanded complexity in the system. This is a big part of why so many content management systems fail and so many organizations hate their content management system. Structured writing can provide new tools for partitioning the complexity of the content process. We can use these tools to partition our systems in new ways the provide a more comprehensive and effective management of the complexity of our content systems.
    
    This book seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of how different structured writing techniques can be used to partition and distribute the complexity of content creation. It does not advocate for any one system. Nor will it tell you exactly which combination of techniques and tools will be right for your organization. Different organizations have different kinds of complexity to deal with and need to distribute it in different ways to maximize the quality of the content they produce. Finding the right combination of techniques for your organization is up to you. Hopefully, though, this book will give your the information you need to figure out what will work best, whether that means adopting or adapting an existing system or building all or part of a system for yourself.
