    I noted that lightweight markup languages such as {Markdown} rely on patterns in the text rather than explicit markup characters to delineate basic structures. XML, on the other hand, makes a strict distinction between what is markup and what is text. Markup is always recognized explicitly by markup sequences that cannot occur as normal text in any part of the document. 
    
    All the same, even XML markup is defined by patterns. The {XML specification}(standard) defines XML using a series of patterns written in a notation called {EBNF}(language). The difference between XML syntax and Markdown syntax is that in XML, patterns are defined absolutely, so a markup start character is a markup start character no matter where it occurs, whereas in Markdown, the patterns are defined in context, so a `*` character starts a list item only at the beginning of a line, not the end. 
    
    Since markup is all about patterns, you are not confined only to the patterns defined by the markup language itself. There are lots of patterns that occur naturally in content, and you can recognize those patterns and act on them with algorithms even if they are not formally marked up in your markup language. 
    
    A common example of this is the pattern of a URL. In most Web-based editors, if you enter a URL as plain text (with no markup identifying it as a URL), the editor recognizes the pattern and turns the URL into a clickable link in the HTML output. 
    
    Recognizing patterns, rather than forcing writers to mark them up explicitly, can increase functional lucidity significantly. Consider something as simple as a date. A date is a complex piece of data consisting of at least three elements, the year, month, and day. (It gets more complex if you include the day of the week or the time.) If you need those individual components of a date for processing purposes, you might be tempted to require dates to be marked up like this:
    
    ```(sam)
        date: {2016}(year)-{08}(month)-{25}(day)
        
    or
    
    ```(sam)
        date:
            year: 2016
            month: 08
            day: 25
        
    This is fully explicit markup. It places every piece of the data in its own explicit structure. However, it lacks {functional lucidity}. 
    
    A date in the format `2016-08-25` is already a piece of structured markup, which is defined by {ISO 8601}(standard), an international standard. The only problem with marking up a date using this format is that in another context `2016-08-25` could be a mathematical expression that resolves to `1983`. But you can eliminate this potential confusion if you isolate the context so that a processor can recognize when you use an {ISO 8601} date. In other words, all you need to do is create an annotation, as shown here:
    
    ```(sam)
        {1941-12-07}(date) is a day that will live in infamy. 
        
    If you want to enter the date in another format, you can annotate it with the {ISO 8601} format to make the meaning clear to algorithms:
    
    ```(sam)
        {December 7, 1941}(date "1941-12-07") is a day 
        that will live in infamy. 
    
    Of course, a sufficiently clever algorithm could recognize `December 7, 1941` as a date as well, because it is a predictable pattern. One of the defining features of patterns is that you can recognize the semantic equivalence between two patterns that express the same information. You can increase the {functional lucidity} of your markup by recognizing a variety of semantically equivalent patterns, rather than imposing a uniform syntax on writers.
    
    section: Design implications
    
        XML recognizes the value of patterns. The XML data types standard[https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/] defines a number of common patterns, and the XML schema language ({XSD})[https://www.w3.org/standards/xml/schema] allows you to define patterns for use in your own markup. It calls these patterns "simple types" (as opposed to "complex types," which are composed of multiple nested elements). Thus, in {XSD}, you can specify that the contents of a date field must conform to the simple type `xs:date`, which is a pattern based on {ISO 8601}. If the schema defines the data type for the `date` element as `xs:date`, you can do following:
        
        ```(xml)
            <date>1941-12-07</date> is a day that will live in infamy. 
        
        It is important to understand what this does. If the type of element `date` in your XML markup language is defined as `xs:date`, then an XSD {schema validator}(tool) will accept `1941-12-07` as a valid date but reject `<date>last Thursday</date>` as invalid. It does not break the date down into year, month, and day components. If you need that, you have to get your algorithm to do that job. But your algorithm can reliably break down the date because the markup constrains the interpretation, establishing that it is indeed an {ISO 1806} date. Most programming languages have library functions that know how to manipulate {ISO 8601} dates, so you probably don't have to do any work yourself to get the year, month, and day components of a date. 
            
        For other patterns, most programming languages have a library called "regular expressions," which you can use to rip a pattern apart and get at the pieces. XSD goes a step further and lets you define new patterns using regular expressions. {Regular expressions}(tool) let your algorithms decode patterns in your content, as long as those patterns are sufficiently constrained by their context. This frees writers from having to explicitly break down many types of information into separate fields. 
        
        For example, in most of our recipe examples, we have explicitly broken down the items in an ingredient list into ingredient, quantity, and unit of measure like this:
        
        ```(sam)
            ingredients:: ingredient, quantity, unit
                eggs, 12, each
                water, 2, qt
            
        That format is not terribly onerous to write, but there is still a small functional lucidity penalty. A writer might more naturally write:
        
        ```(sam)
            ingredients::
                eggs 12
                water 2qt
        
        Ingredient name, quantity, and unit of measure are still distinct. Any human reader can see them instantly. The trick is to get an algorithm to read them the same way. This trick can be accomplished fairly easily using a regular expression:[*fn.regex]
        
        ```(re)
            (?P<ingredient>.+?)(?P<quantity>\d+)(?P<unit>qt|tsp|tbsp)?
            
        footnote:(*fn.regex)
            This regular expression is deliberately simple and does not include a full list of all the possible names for units of measures. You would need a more precise expression for production quality code, but it would be distractingly verbose for our present purpose.
            
        To show you how this works, here is a set of ingredient values:
        
        ```(text)
            eggs 12
            water 4qt
            salt 1tsp
            butter 2tbsp
            pork chops 4

        Here is the result of applying the regular expression above to those values (this is a report generated by regex101.com, a fantastic site for designing and testing regular expressions):
        
        ```(text)
            Match 1
            Full match    0-7    `eggs 12`
            Group `ingredient`    0-5    `eggs `
            Group `quantity`    5-7    `12`
            
            Match 2
            Full match    8-17    `water 4qt`
            Group `ingredient`    8-14    `water `
            Group `quantity`    14-15    `4`
            Group `unit`    15-17    `qt`
            
            Match 3
            Full match    18-27    `salt 1tsp`
            Group `ingredient`    18-23    `salt `
            Group `quantity`    23-24    `1`
            Group `unit`    24-27    `tsp`
            
            Match 4
            Full match    28-40    `butter 2tbsp`
            Group `ingredient`    28-35    `butter `
            Group `quantity`    35-36    `2`
            Group `unit`    36-40    `tbsp`
            
            Match 5
            Full match    41-53    `pork chops 4`
            Group `ingredient`    41-52    `pork chops `
            Group `quantity`    52-53    `4`
            
                
        As you can see, the regular expression has broken each ingredient down into ingredient, quantity, and unit fields, just like our explicit markup did. The conventional way of writing ingredients, in other words, is just as structured as our formal way. It just takes a line of code to pull them out of the string. Once again we are partitioning and transferring a bit of complexity from the writer to the {information architect} or {content engineer}.
        
        Essentially, any expression that you commonly use in text and that follows a well-defined pattern is already structured text, and you don't need to structure it again. All you need to do is to use structure to place it into context so that an algorithm can recognize it reliably. For example, the regular expression for breaking down the components of an ingredient listing only works when applied to text that you are sure is an ingredient listing. Thus, you use normal structured text to delineate the ingredients list and each list item. This provides the necessary context for an algorithm to use the ingredient list pattern to pull out the ingredient, quantity, and unit fields without forcing the writer to make them explicit in the text. 
        
        Avoiding unnecessary markup of already recognizable patterns both simplifies your markup design and increase the {functional lucidity} of your markup languages. 
        
        If you were creating this recipe structure in {XML} and using {XML Schema} (XSD) as your schema language, you could create a data type for the ingredient field that would verify that the text matched the expected pattern (see [*fig.xsd-ingredients]).

        figure:(*fig.xsd-ingredients) XSD schema type definition for ingredients
            ```(xsd)
                <xsd:element name="ingredient">
                    <xsd:simpleType>
                        <xsd:restriction base="xsd:string">
                            <xsd:pattern value="(.+?)(\d+)(qt|tsp|tbsp)?"/>
                        </xsd:restriction>
                    </xsd:simpleType>
                </xsd:element>  
        
        This type definition ensures that an error will be raised if the writer enters ingredients in the wrong form or uses the wrong names for units. For instance, these ingredient list items would trigger an error:
        
        ```(xml)
            <ingredients>
                <ingredient>12 eggs</ingredient> 
                <ingredient>water 2 cups</ingredient>
                <ingredient>butter 4 lumps</ingredient>
            </ingredients>
                
        The first `ingredient` fails because the quantity (12) appears before the ingredient, not after. The next two fail because cups and lumps are not on the list of strings recognized by the pattern, which probably should be extended to allow cups, but not lumps. In [*fig.xsd-ingredients], the names of the fields that were present in the original regular expression are omitted because XML schema is not going to break the values apart and put them in separate fields for us. As far as XML schema is concerned, this is just the definition of a single element. It would be up to a processing application to break the pieces apart into make separate fields. My design intent for {SAM} is that its schema language will let you do just this: define multiple fields with a regular expression that tells you how to break a string apart and names the individual fields to extract from the pattern. 
        
        By the way, though I have used the ingredients listing as an example here, I probably would not use this pattern in a production system. While the `eggs, 12, each` structure is a tiny bit unnatural, its explicitness makes it less error prone. It is less likely that writers will get the order of information wrong and have to pause to deal with an error message. Asking writers to break the information apart explicitly is probably the lesser of two evils. When using patterns to improve functional lucidity, you need to balance naturalness against explicitness.
