    However you design your content process, the key to its success is repeatability. Making it work once is great, but real success is making it work reliably day after day. 

    One of the biggest challenges to repeatability in content processes is determining whether you are repeating the right things and repeating them successfully. Content is one of the hardest products to test. One of the biggest barriers to consistently producing quality content is being able to test whether your content persuades, informs, entertains, or enables the reader to act as intended.
    
    The problem has two parts:

    * It is hard to observe the effect of content. You aren't there to watch people read it.

    * Even when you can observe the effect of content on the reader, how do you know what aspects of your content's rhetoric achieved the effect you observed?

    Making these observations on individual pieces of content is of limited value. Yes, you can do A/B testing -- putting up multiple versions of content, observing which versions work best, and taking down content that does not perform well. And you can test other changes until you finally create a piece of content that performs well. But then, how do you reproduce that success with the next piece of content? How do you discover the rhetorical pattern that contributed to its success and should be emulated in future content? 
    
    Measuring content is not like measuring minivans or cans of peas, where every example is supposed to be exactly alike. Every piece of content is supposed to be different. It is great to find that you have a successful ad or blog post or manual topic, but to repeat that success, you have to look beyond the individual item and see what it has in common with other successful items. You need to find, and reproduce, the common rhetorical patterns shared by many different pieces of successful content.

    Some part of the success of individual items doubtless lies in characteristics that they alone possess -- your review of a Harry Potter movie is going to get more hits than your review of an art-house flop, for reasons entirely unrelated to the quality of your reviews -- but much of it also comes from meeting specific user needs in accessible ways, and, in that case, there is often a pattern that can be repeated. Did your review of Harry Potter get more or fewer views than the next site's review of Harry Potter? Do your reviews of art-house flops get more views than theirs? What is it about your reviews that makes them more popular, regardless of the popularity of the movie? 

    Maybe it's your acerbic wit, of course, which is not easy for another writer to reproduce, but maybe it is the rhetorical pattern of your reviews -- how you present the information that moviegoers really care about in a format that is clear and easy to read. If so, that pattern should be repeated across all your reviews. 

    Many content types, such as recipes, have generic rhetorical patterns that everyone knows and uses, but you can create more specific versions of these rhetorical patterns that will make your content work better than your rivals' content. With recipes, maybe there is a pattern that makes it particularly easy for your readers to choose which dishes they can prepare successfully. If so, you should repeat that pattern across all of your recipes. While literary charm doubtless counts for something -- and for more in some forms of content than in others -- saying the right things in the most accessible way is still the bread and butter of content quality, and structured writing is the best way to deliver quality repeatably.  

    Trying to derive lessons from a single piece of successful content is little more than an educated guess. You are abstracting from a single data point. To determine which aspects of your content contribute the most to its success, you need to observe multiple samples that exhibit the same features. When you see successful results from multiple pieces of content that exhibit the same features, you have some assurance that those features are what make the content successful. Once you know this, you can reliably produce new content that will be similarly successful. You have achieved {repeatability}. 

    It is beyond the scope of this book to examine specific content testing methodologies. But meaningful testing requires repeatability. The focus here is on how to achieve repeatability so you can test effectively using whatever testing methodology you choose. 
    
    To achieve repeatability, you need to partition those {rhetorical} elements that you want repeated and constrain your writers to follow them. But it isn't enough to constrain rhetorical patterns after the fact, when you already know what works. If you don't have multiple examples of the same pattern to test, you can't draw useful conclusions about which elements of the pattern work and which don't. You not only have to constrain in order to repeat, you have to constrain in order to measure. Without constraints, you don't know what you are measuring. 
    
    In order to generalize your measurements, so you can draw conclusions that apply to more than one piece of content, you need to make sure that each piece of content you are measuring has the same structures and features. That is the only way to be sure that it is the structures and features, rather than the individual texts, that are driving the results you measure. You need consistent {conformant} content structures that express those features of a text that affect its quality. Until you have that, you have no reliable basis on which to extrapolate findings from your measurements. In order to achieve {repeatability} in content creation, therefore, you need structured writing. 

    The most fundamental part of content quality is to give readers the information they need in a form they can use. A confounding aspect of content quality is that every reader is different. They are doing different things, they have different experiences, and they have different vocabularies. 

    For writers in corporate environments, lack of knowledge about the readers, their tasks, and their backgrounds, is often the biggest problem they face in determining what content is required and what form it should take. While direct contact with customers is undoubtedly the best way to address this problem, you can learn what content to create without ever meeting your readers, as long as you can measure the performance of your content, generalize your results, and repeat the structures that perform best.

    If the bread and butter of content {quality} is to provide the right pieces of information in the most accessible way, and if you have some means of measuring the impact of your content, then you can use strictly constrained patterns and testing to establish what information and which presentation of that information works best for your audience. While it is best to seed this process based on direct knowledge of your readers, ultimately, tests and measurements are the most reliable way to learn what content works for your readers, even if you don't know exactly why it works.   

    Without known-good patterns and reliable tests, only personal knowledge of your readers will help you craft content that meets their needs. But this means that every writer must do reader research and information design work every time, with a limited body of information and few, if any, opportunities to test the design. The time required for each writer to do this research and design work is a huge overhead for the organization and a huge amount of repeated effort. If writers don't spend the time to do it right, the content probably won't meet the reader's needs. As much as we talk about the potential cost savings of information reuse, the potential cost savings and quality improvements from reusing known, good rhetorical patterns verified by testing is enormous.    
    
    Organizations often look to {content reuse} as the principle source of cost savings in the content system. But content reuse can be expensive to implement. Cost savings are not guaranteed, and quality problems can result from an overzealous approach to reuse. {Repeatability}, which you can think of as the {reuse of patterns} rather than individual pieces of content, can be a huge time-saver and one that, if applied correctly, can bring big quality gains. And the kinds of constrained patterns that provide repeatability also direct the complexity of information design away from contributors, opening the way to greater {collaboration} by bringing in writers who are experts in the subject matter but not {information design} and who do not have the time or inclination to use complex {content management} or {reuse} systems. You should consider carefully whether {repeatability}, rather than {reuse}, should be the first place you look to reduce costs in your content system. 
    
    Every structured writing domain provides support for {repeatability}. Word processor style sheets ensure repeatability in the formatting of headings and lists. {Document-domain} languages such as {DITA} and {DocBook} provide repeatability in document structures (but only to the extent that they constrain the use of such structures). However, to get repeatability in the {rhetorical structure} of content, you need to turn to the {subject domain}. 

    Finally, while I have focused on rhetorical repeatability in this chapter, partitioning complexity to make sure it is handled by a person or process that has the knowledge, skills, and resources to handle it contributes to repeatability at every point in the content process. And here again, we see the importance of conformance to known good patterns, because the effectiveness and reliability of algorithms depends entirely on the quality of the content and metadata that is passed to them.
