    If rhetoric and process are inseparable, how do we structure content to support both at the same time? We have seen how structured writing can constrain or factor out many aspects of rhetoric. But how are those structures compatible with the processes we need to run on our content? To answer this, we must look at the principle structured writing algorithms.  

    Structured writing algorithms basically come down to four operations: separate, combine, relate, and transform. The chapters in this part we will look at how these basic operations are used to implement the fundamental structured writing algorithms. 
    
    However, these are not chapters on programming. Defining an algorithm and writing software to implement that algorithm are two separate tasks. This part introduces you to the design and capability of structured writing algorithms, not to the coding of software. 

    In this part we will look at the algorithms that manipulate content itself. In [#part.process] we will look at the algorithms that support the management of the content set.
