    Most books on structured writing begin by describing structures: the various ways you can partition documents. Only later do they talk about algorithms: the way you process documents.

    I think this is the wrong way to look at the problem. We structure documents for three main reasons:
    
    * To govern rhetoric, what we say and how we say it
    * To enable us to manage content and the processes that create it
    * To enable us to process documents with algorithms

    Structures are merely enablers. Until we know what rhetoric we want to govern and what algorithms we want to run, there is no point in talking about structure. 

    And since any structure we create to govern rhetoric must also be processable by publishing algorithms, there is no point in talking about rhetorical structures until we understand the requirements of algorithms. 

    And since we mostly manage content using algorithms (and can manage it more effectively the more of the management task we can delegate to algorithms), and since management requirements must take a back seat to rhetorical requirements is quality is to be maintained, there is no point in talking about management until we understand both algorithms and structure.

    Therefore, this book begins with algorithms, in this part, and continues with rhetoric and structure in the next part, and management in the following parts.
