    If rhetoric and process are inseparable, how do you structure content to support both at the same time? I have described how structured writing can constrain or factor out many aspects of rhetoric. But how are those structures compatible with the processes you need to run on your content? To answer this, we must look at the principal structured writing algorithms.  

    Structured writing algorithms basically come down to four operations: separate, combine, relate, and transform. The chapters in this part look at how to use these basic operations to implement the fundamental structured writing algorithms. 
    
    However, these are not chapters on programming. Defining an algorithm and writing software to implement that algorithm are two separate tasks. This part introduces the design and capabilities of the structured writing algorithms, but it does not describe how to code software to implement those algorithms.

    In this part, I look at algorithms for manipulating content itself. In [#part.management], I look at algorithms for managing the content set.
