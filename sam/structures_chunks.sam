chapter:(#chapter.blocks) Blocks, fragments, paragraphs, and phrases

    <<<(annotations.sam)

    Since structured documents are made up of nested blocks, how do you design a content structure as a set of nested blocks? Let's start by looking at the different types of blocks, their purpose, and how they relate to each other. Most markup systems don't make a high-level distinction between different types of blocks (for example, in XML, they are all elements). However, from a language design point of view, it is useful to break down blocks into different types, each of which requires a different design focus.

    This chapter considers three different ways of looking at blocks (semantic, information typing, and rhetorical) and the advantages and disadvantages of each. It then looks at fragments, paragraphs, and phrases and how these smaller blocks fit into structured writing.
    
    !!!(RLH)
        I reworked the introduction a bit to let readers know that you will be dealing with three different ways of considering blocks. That didn't really come through until I'd read through some of this. I'm not 100% happy with the rewrite, but I think it's a starting place to give readers a short preview of what this chapter is about.
    
    section: Semantic blocks
    
        If you ask writers to describe the things that make up a document, they will probably name things like paragraphs, tables, and lists. If you ask about a particular type of document, such as a recipe, they will probably name things like introduction, ingredients, and preparation steps. A structured writing language is typically much more fine-grained than this. For instance, a table may be made up of dozens of smaller structures, such as rows, cells, and cell contents. But tables, procedures, and lists are the units that have meaning to writers independent of how those units are constructed internally. Without knowing anything about the mechanics of structured writing, a writer could design the rhetorical structure of a piece of content as a set of such blocks, creating, for instance, a recipe with three main blocks: introduction, ingredients, and preparation.
    
        At the risk of adding further burden to an already overloaded term, I am going to call these recognizable objects "{semantic blocks}(concept)," because they are blocks that mean something in whichever domain they belong to. Higher level markup design is essentially a matter of defining semantic blocks and the ways they go together. 
        
        An easy example of a semantic block is a list. (Note that I am not using "semantic" to mean subject domain; blocks have semantics in all domains.) A list is a semantic block because "list" is an idea with meaning in the document domain independent of its exact internal structure. A writer can say, "I want a list here," independent of any specifics of markup. If a structure has a name like this in the real world, the block that implements it is a semantic block (in the terminology I am coining for this book). 
        
        Semantic blocks generally contain other blocks that you might not talk about independently if they weren't needed to describe the detailed construction of a semantic block. I call these "structural blocks." Structural blocks are the construction details of a structured document. By analogy, in architectural terms, if a window is a semantic block, the lintel, sash, and jamb are structural blocks.
        
        The distinction between a semantic block and a structural block is not hard and fast. It has more to do with design intent than any concrete characteristic. The main point of making the distinction is to encourage you to think of markup design first in terms of semantic blocks. That is, blocks, with whatever internal structure you require, that capture the structure of something that is real and meaningful to you. Don't get bogged down in the precise internal structure until you figure out which semantic blocks you need.    
        
        Different markup languages often construct the same semantic block differently. {DITA}, {DocBook}, and {HTML} all define lists, and each defines them differently. Nonetheless, you can recognize that each implements a list, and for most purposes, you can mark up your content using any one of them without any loss of functionality. 

        A list is made up of structural blocks that build the shape of a list. [*fig.chunks-1] illustrates this with XML, since it makes the blocks explicit:
        
        figure:(*fig.chunks-1) XML markup for a list
            ```(xml)
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>This is the first item.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>This is the second item.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            
        In [*fig.chunks-1], the semantic block is the ordered list bounded by the `ol` tags. The `li` and `p` tags inside are structural blocks that together implement the structure of an ordered list. (Since paragraphs are semantic blocks, albeit relatively simple ones, this illustrates that a semantic block can also be a structural block for a larger semantic structure.)
            
        Other {document-domain} examples of semantic blocks include {tables}(structure) and {procedures}(structure). For example, DocBook, DITA, and HTML, not to mention S1000D and {reStructuredtext}, all have tables with different internal structures, and both DocBook and DITA have procedures, again internally different. It is possible to disagree greatly about how to structure a semantic block while still recognizing different implementations as examples of the same semantic type. 

        In the subject domain, examples of semantic blocks include the ingredients list from the recipe example we have been using and the parameter description from an API reference (see [*fig.chunk-2]).
        
        figure:(*fig.chunk-2) Subject-domain semantic blocks
            Ingredients list:
            
            ```(sam)
                ingredients:: ingredient, quantity, unit
                    eggs, 3, each
                    salt, 1, tsp
                    butter, .5, cup
    
            Parameter description from an API reference:
            
            ```(sam)
                parameter: string
                    required: yes
                    description:
                        The string to print.

        Semantic blocks often repeat as a unit, as [*fig.chunk-3] shows in an API reference entry.
        
        figure:(*fig.chunk-3) Semantic blocks repeated as a unit
            ```(sam)
                function: print
                    return-value: none
                    parameters:
                        parameter: string
                            required: yes
                            description:
                                The string to print.
                        parameter: end
                            required: no
                            default: '\n'
                            description:
                                The characters to output after the {string}(parameter).
        
        Semantic blocks may also be used as a unit in different places in a markup language or in different markup languages. For instance, the ordered-list semantic block may be allowed in more than one place in a document-domain language, such as in a section or in a table cell. 
        
        In fact, if you have multiple markup languages in your content system, particularly multiple subject-domain languages, then it makes a lot of sense to define a common set of semantic blocks for use across all of these languages. Thus, if you have five subject-domain languages that all require lists, you can use the same list structure across all five of those languages.

        This means that you can define the structure of a list and all of the algorithms that work on lists just once and reuse them for every subject-domain language that shares those structures. It also means that your authors only have to learn one definition for each semantic structure, which makes it much easier for them to learn several different subject domain languages.

        If you do this, then each subject-domain language only has to define, and provide processing algorithms for, those structures that are unique to the subject matter. All the other structures you need to create content in your environment are already defined, tested, and ready to use. This makes it much quicker and simpler to design and implement a new subject domain language when you need one.         

        Designing in terms of semantic blocks not only helps keep markup design and processing simpler, it also improves {functional lucidity}. If you present your markup language to writers as a set of familiar objects such lists and tables or as logical structures such as an ingredients list or parameter description -- rather than as a sea of tags -- you make their job easier.
        
        Semantic blocks also make things easier for tools developers. An XML editor that implements a WYSIWYG interface to XML authoring can provide tool bar buttons for inserting semantic blocks such as lists or tables. This allows the author to enter these blocks as complete structures rather than having to enter every tag separately. 

        The structure of a semantic block can be strict or loose. A strict semantic block has one basic structure with few options. A loose one allows a much wider variety of structure inside, sometimes to the point that it acts more as a semantic wrapper than a defined semantic block. 

        {DocBook} is an example of a language with loose semantic blocks. DocBook has the same high-level semantic blocks as any other generalized document-domain markup language, but it allows so many tags in so many places that none of these objects are simple and easy to understand. Even though you can use DocBook to describe almost any document structure you might want to create, this flexibility reduces functional lucidity and constraint.

        How do you balance flexibility with functional lucidity and constraint in creating semantic blocks? Sometimes it is best to have more than one implementation of a particular semantic block. For instance, both DITA and DocBook have two table models, a simple model and a more complex one based on the CALS table model.
        
    section: Information-typing blocks

            !!!(RLH)
                I've hyphenated "information-typing" blocks when used as an adjective, which I think is correct, but I'm open to discussion on the point if you disagree.
                
        We have looked at examples of {semantic blocks}, which can be in both the {document domain} (lists and tables) and the {subject domain} (ingredients list and parameter description). Another way some structured writing systems divide content into blocks is according to the type of information they contain. I call these information-typing blocks, since the practice of dividing content into such blocks is commonly called "information typing" (though this is obviously not the only thing the words "information typing" could refer to, since all structured writing assigns information to types). 
        
        An information-typing block is a type of semantic block, but information-typing blocks introduce a degree of abstraction not found with most semantic blocks. Unless they have been trained in an information-typing system such as Information Mapping®[http://www.informationmapping.com] or DITA, most writers are not going to naturally describe the rhetorical structure of their content in terms of information-typing blocks.
                    
        {Information Mapping}(tool) is a structured writing system that views all content as being made up of just six types of information block: Procedure, Process, Principle, Concept, Structure, and Fact. These are information-typing blocks. They don't directly describe a physical or logical element of document structure (except for procedure) nor are they specific to any one subject. They describe the kind of idea that the content conveys -- they are based on a theory about how humans receive information. 

        Which structured writing domain do information-typing blocks belong to? Clearly they are not {media}-, {subject}-, or {management-domain} structures. Are they a kind of {document-domain} structure or something else again? I believe it is more useful to regard them as document-domain structures than to invent another domain. Information Mapping is a theory about the construction of documents to make them more effective. It regards a document as a mapping of information-typing blocks, so Information Mapping's information-typing blocks are components of documents and, therefore, in the document domain.       
        
        {DITA} also adopted this idea of documents being made up of information-typing blocks. In DITA's case, these blocks are named _topics_, which leads to some confusion since the word topic can be used to refer to both an information-typing block and also to a complete document (as in a "help topic" for instance). 
        
        DITA has popularized the idea that all content (or all technical content, at least) is made up of just three information-typing blocks: concept, task, and reference,[*1] although newer releases of DITA define more topic types than this. This idea is appealing because it is simple, and it is easy to see a correspondence between these three types and the reader activities of learning (concept), doing (task), and looking stuff up (reference). The question is whether it provides adequate or appropriate constraints for the rhetoric of your content and whether it is useful for partitioning the complexity of your content system.
        
        footnote:(*1)
        
            There is evidence that DITA is moving away from this vision of information typing. In DITA 1.3, the technical committee puts the emphasis on topic and map as the core types, rather than concept, task, and reference.  
            
            """[http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/dita-1.3-why-three-editions/v1.0/cn01/dita-1.3-why-three-editions-v1.0-cn01.html#focus-of-dita]
                The DITA Technical Committee wants to emphasize that topic and map are the base document types in the architecture.

                Because DITA was originally developed within IBM as a solution for technical documentation, early information about DITA stressed the importance of the concept, task, and reference topics.

                Many regarded the topic document type as nothing more than a specialization base for concept, task, and reference.

                While this perspective might still be valid for technical content, times have changed. DITA now is used in many other contexts, and people developing content for these other contexts need new specializations. For example, nurses who develop evidence-based care sheets might need a topic specialization that has sections for evidence, impact on current practices, and bibliographic references.

            Stating that the evidence-based care sheets example would include information from more than one abstract type and proposing this example as a specialization of topic -- rather than concept, task, or reference -- both suggest a significant shift in thinking on this point and may indicate a shift away from abstract information typing towards a more concrete subject-domain approach.
        
        This simple triptych is also appealing because it promises (though it does not necessarily deliver) easy {composability} for {content reuse}. Some people also maintain that it makes content easier to access for readers, though others (myself included) criticize it on the grounds that it tends to break content down too finely to be useful and robs content of its narrative thread.

        Since neither {Information Mapping} nor {DITA} provide any mechanism for constraining how information-typing blocks go together to form documents, they do not provide much support for creating and maintaining repeatable rhetorical structures. (This does not mean that authors can't create such structures, but the complexity of doing so falls entirely on them, with the added complexity of having to construct the rhetorical structure out of a jigsaw puzzle of abstract information-typing blocks.) DITA, however, does allow you to create much more specific content types. See [#chapter.extensible] for more details.

        This abstract information typing is distinct from the subject-based information typing of the {subject domain}. {DITA} and {Information Mapping}’s approaches are broad and analytical, trying to find commonalities across many different kinds of information. The subject domain is specific and synthetic, concerned with how specific pieces go together to successfully describe a particular subject. Both approaches break content into blocks, and the subject-specific blocks of the subject domain can probably be categorized according to the information typology of either {DITA} or {Information Mapping}. 

        !!!(RLH)
            Up to this point, I'm with you 100%. I like this a lot. However, you lost me with the next paragraph. I think you're asking whether it's better to start from a subject-domain point of view or a document-domain point of view, but I can't tell for sure, so I'm a bit lost.

        From a design point of view, the question is whether is is easier to arrive at a concrete structure for describing a particular subject by simply observing in concrete terms the particular pieces of information that are required to describe that subject, or by first identifying its abstract type and then deriving a specific type by extension or specialization of the abstract type. This is probably an area in which it depends on the designer's habits of mind. For me, defining specific types in concrete terms based on observed information needs is simple and more straightforward, but the result matters more than the process in these things and you should take which ever approach works for you.       
        
    section: Rhetorical blocks
    
        !!!(RLH)
            I think you may need to expand the first sentence a bit to explain why "Neither semantic blocks nor information typing blocks constitute ..." Your second paragraph begins to do that, but not before you pose a question that you don't answer for another three paragraphs, during which you pose two more questions. The result is confusing. After that rocky start, I think this settles down into a good section starting around the fourth paragraph. Can you look over the first few paragraphs with that in mind?

        Neither semantic blocks nor information typing blocks constitute a complete piece of content suitable for the reader to read. That unit is the unit that is rhetorically complete -- that persuades, informs, entertains, or enables the reader to act. I will call it the rhetorical block. Rhetorical structure is the structure of the rhetorical block. The structure of a rhetorical block is made of up smaller semantic and structural blocks, but it is the structure of the rhetorical block that provides control over the completeness and repeatability of a content type. The question is, does the rhetorical block have a consistent repeatable structure that we can successfully model and control?
        
        Part of the attraction of information typing theory is that you can divide everything you write into information typing blocks. (It does not matter if your information typing system has three, six, or thirty types, everything fits because there is always one type in the system that is effectively "everything else".) And because maps are not constrained in an information typing system, there are no limits on how you can put information typing blocks together to form rhetorical blocks. You can apply information mapping to everything you write. You can apply out-of-the-box DITA (with more or less struggle) to everything you write. 

        The question is, does doing this optimize your process and rhetoric, leading to better content being delivered to your readers? Or would your process and rhetoric be better served by a system that constrained the rhetorical block, ensuring that the rhetoric is complete and that the values used for processing are explicit and consistent? As we have seen, there are many advantages to constraining the rhetorical block, but the key advantage is {repeatability}. This is not simply because repeatability allows you to produce quality content more quickly and reliably. It is also because it makes content quality testable in a repeatable manner. You don't just test the quality of an individual piece, but of a repeatable pattern (as we will see in [#chapter.repeatability]).          
        
        Do all rhetorical blocks have a repeatable pattern? Certainly not. This book is a rhetorical block, but it does not have a repeatable pattern that one could define as a specific data structure. (Hopefully there is a structure to its rhetoric, but it is not one that lends itself to modeling as a set of nested blocks.) Although this book encourages the use of the {subject domain} for structured writing, it was not written in the subject domain. It was written in {SAM} syntax in a small constrained document-domain language with a number of {subject-domain} {annotations} for things such as markup languages, markup concepts, and processing tools. 
        
        But not all physical books constitute a single rhetorical block. Many books, such as cookbooks, are collections of related rhetorical blocks, such as recipes. Not only can you define a repeatable rhetorical block for a recipe, doing so provides significant benefits for most of the structured writing algorithms and allows you to effectively partition and direct the content complexity of a cookbook publisher or a magazine publisher that inserts recipes into many different publications. 
        
        Where you can reasonably define repeatably structured rhetorical blocks in your content, there are good reasons to do so. One approach is to take the rhetorical blocks that you produce now, identify those that could be repeatably structured, and develop a structure to contain and constrain them. This may involve moving some content around, since the applications of a repeatable structure will inevitably reveal that some content is in the wrong place, some is missing, and some is superfluous. But overall, this is a reasonably straightforward process. 

        A second approach is to take material that is currently in long discursive rhetorical blocks (such as text books) and move it to much shorter and more structured rhetorical blocks (such as recipes or encyclopedia articles). Breaking material into smaller rhetorical units is not a new idea. It has been practiced in encyclopedias and periodicals for centuries, and it has greatly accelerated in the age of the Web, which has not only improved our access to information, it has radically changed how we seek and use information, creating a style called {information snacking}[https://www.nngroup.com/articles/information-scent/] in which readers reach for discrete pieces of information as and when they need them, confident that they will always be able to rapidly find and read what they need when the time arises.[*2] In other words, people prefer to consume content in shorter rhetorical blocks (not because they need to know less, but because they need to know less at a time), so it makes sense to refactor your content and its architecture into a collection of smaller rhetorical blocks.
        
        footnote:(*2)
            I discuss this change of information seeking and consuming habits in my book {Every Page is Page One: Topic-based Writing for Technical Communication and the Web}(citetitle).
        
        This transformation to shorter rhetorical blocks is often called _topic-based writing_, but that term has become quite confusing because it is also used to mean a system in which, instead of writing in long rhetorical blocks, individual writers write independent information-typing blocks that are then compiled into long rhetorical blocks, often by somebody else. The confusion caused by giving these two very different approach the same name is that some people have started to think that topic-based writing means writing information-typing blocks and then publishing them separately as if they were rhetorical blocks. This confusions is compounded by the {DITA} Technical Committee's decision to call their information-typing blocks _topics_ (Information Mapping calls them _blocks_) and because publishing each information-typing block separately is the default behavior when you publish a DITA map to the web. 
        
        But while a single information-typing block may sometimes be a rhetorical block all by itself, this is often not the case. Whether one believes in the usefulness of information-typing theory or not, it is clear that most useful rhetorical blocks contain more than one type of information. 
        
        I have attempted to distinguish topics as complete rhetorical blocks from topics as information-typing blocks by coining the term "Every Page is Page One topic." Why "Every Page is Page One"? Because a complete rhetorical block, regardless of its length, is a block that an information-snacking reader will consume independently of any larger work or collection in which it is embedded. It is page one for that reader. And since information-snacking readers use search to dive directly down to the individual page they want, every rhetorical block in your collection is going to be page one for some reader. I explore the design of Every Page Is Page One topics in my book {Every Page is Page One: Topic-based Writing for Technical Communication and the Web}(citetitle).
        
        But does an Every Page is Page One topic have any more reason to follow a constrained rhetorical block structure than a book? Yes, and, as I explore in {Every Page is Page One}(citetitle), there is a broad tendency for topics to demonstrate a consistent rhetorical pattern once they become smaller and are accessed in an Every Page is Page One fashion. This makes the information in these topics more accessible to the information-snacking reader, both because it makes them easier to find and recognize and because it ensures that they do the job they are supposed to do more completely and consistently. 
        
        Additionally, as I explored in [#chapter.architecture], Every Page is Page One topics are part of the way you create a {bottom-up information architecture} -- one in which readers enter by search or by following a link and navigate the information set from the point they arrived. Building and maintaining a bottom-up information architecture is much much easier if you do it algorithmically using {subject-domain} {linking} and information architecture algorithms. Thus creating subject-domain rhetorical block types for as much of your content as will fit a repeating pattern is key to creating and managing a bottom-up information architecture.
        
        Deciding if you want to model and constrain your rhetorical blocks is therefore one of the most important decisions you make in designing your content system and determining how complexity will be partitioned and directed in that system. 
        
        section: Granularity
    
            There can be a conflict between ease of writing and ease of {content management}. The designers of content management systems typically want to manage content down to a fine level of granularity, especially for purposes of {content reuse}. Content management algorithms may be best served by managing fairly small chunks of content -- semantic units rather than rhetorical units. But for writers, writing something less than a rhetorical unit can be difficult. Writers can find it difficult to get a sense of how well a particular semantic block will meet a reader's needs when they don't see the rhetorical block that block will fit into.

            It is hard to create discrete parts, unless the parts are really well defined. Writers are trained to construct entire essays and are able to structure them well as a whole. But it is hard to correctly structure a part without clear and explicit guidance -- the kind of guidance you do not get from a generic information-typing block such as concept, task, or reference.  

 
    section: Fragments
    
        Another division of content, found mostly in relationship to the management domain, is the {fragment}. By fragment I mean a chunk of text that is not a semantic block, an information-typing block, or a rhetorical block. A fragment is a block that you manage independently of the surrounding text. In other words, it is a block that has no rhetorical role and exists purely for process purposes.
        
        For example, in a {content-reuse} scenario, you might want to make an item in a list conditional based on which version of a product that list item applies to.
        
        Individual list items are not semantic blocks. They are just structural blocks of a list. When you make list items conditional, you are actually creating multiple separate lists with some items in common and recording them as a single list. You might be able to attach reasonably informative metadata to any one of those lists as a whole, but there is usually not a lot you can say about individual list items. They are fragments of a list. When you apply conditions to them, you are applying those conditions to fragments. 
        
        In some {reuse} systems, including {DITA} and {DocBook}, you can apply conditions to arbitrary bits of text -- three words in sentence for instance. The block that sets off those three words in a fragment. 
        
        Some reuse systems also allow you to reuse arbitrary bits of text from other parts of the content set, simply because the text is the same in each case. Those bits of text would be fragments. 
        
        In some cases, you can turn an existing structural block into a fragment by attaching {management-domain} metadata to it. In other cases, you have to introduce additional markup into the document to delineate the fragment. 
        
        Fragments definitely solve some problems, but they are also inherently unstructured and unconstrained. It is easy to get into trouble with fragments. It is easy to create relationships and dependencies that are hard to manage because they don't follow any structural logic. You should use them with great caution and restraint. 
    
        
    section: Paragraphs and phrases
    
        Paragraphs are the one thing that makes structured content different from other computable data sets. This is not because of the paragraph structure per se, but because of the way we annotate phrases within the paragraphs. It is rare in any other data set to see a structure floating within the value of another structure. But that is exactly what happens when you annotate phrases in a paragraph.

        In this example, the annotation on the phrases "Rio Bravo" and "the Duke" float in the middle of the paragraph block. Here is the same thing in XML:
        
        ```(xml)
            <p>In <movie>Rio Bravo</movie>, 
            <actor name="John Wayne">the Duke</actor> 
            plays an ex-Union colonel.</p>

        Here the `movie` and `actor` elements float in the content of the `p` element. In XML parlance, this is called _mixed content_. If fact, XML breaks the structure of elements down into three types:
        
        |element content| Elements that contain only other elements. 
        
        |data content| Elements that contain only text data.
        
        |mixed content| Elements that contain both text data and elements. 
        
        Mixed content is the reason that most traditional data formats are not a good fit for content. They may be able to model element content and data content, but they lack an elegant way to model mixed content. 
        
        Even conventional programming languages have trouble with mixed content. In fact most libraries for XML processing invent an additional wrapper around each string of characters in a mixed content element, effectively representing it as if it were written like this (without mixed content):
        
        ```(xml)
            <p><text>In </text><movie>Rio Bravo</movie><text>, 
            </text><actor name="John Wayne">the Duke</actor><text> 
            plays an ex-Union colonel.</text></p>
        
        But while this makes the content easier to process for programming languages, it is clearly false to the actual structure of the document. Structured writing is essentially about reflecting the structure of thought or presentation in a narrative, and narratives have a structure that is not shared with other data. Indeed, you might say that all other data formats exist as an attempt to extract information from the narrative format to make it easier to process.
        
        Thus you are taught in school that if you are presented with a problem in this format:
            
        """
            John had 4 apples and Mary had 5 apples. They place their apples in a basket. Bill eats 2 apples. How many apples are left in the basket?
            
        You solve it by first extracting the data from the narrative:
        
        ```
            4 + 5 - 2 =
            
        But with content, while you can sometimes extract the data from the content, you also need to retain the content or the means to recreate the content, since the content (not the answer) is the product you are trying to produce. 
        
        When you move content to the {subject domain}, you will, in some cases, break down paragraphs and isolate data with the intention of recreating paragraphs algorithmically on output or switching from a narrative to a data-oriented reporting of the subject matter. Either way, this process makes the data easier for algorithms to handle and, thus, makes most of the structured writing algorithms work better. (You may have noticed that the {subject domain} provides the most constrained and elegant solution to many structured writing algorithms.)
        
        Even so, it is not always possible to do a complete breakdown of all paragraphs when refactoring content to the subject domain. Therefore, most subject-domain markup languages use paragraphs and other basic text structures and allow writers to annotate phrases within paragraphs. Only narrative is capable of expressing the full variety and subtlety of the real-world relationships between things, and only narrative is capable of conveying these things effectively to most human readers. Even things that can be fully described to algorithms with fielded data must be described to human audiences with narrative.

            You mention ontologies just once in the book, as far as I can tell. I think you need to either define ontology or use another term to make this point. Actually, you might be able to simply remove "Unlike ontologies," and you will still make the same point.
            
        {Subject-domain} structured writing extends the reach of more conventional algorithms into the world of narrative to enable specific structured writing algorithms and to provide rhetorical constraints to improve the quality of the writing. Unlike {ontologies}(concept), subject-domain structured writing does not attempt to capture the whole semantics of a narrative, just to discipline and structure narrative to achieve specific content creation objectives -- a particular partitioning of content complexity.
        
        Every structured writing domain needs to annotate phrases. {Media-domain} structured writing needs to annotate phrases to describe formatting. The {document domain} needs to annotate phrases to describe their role in the document. The {management domain} needs to annotate phrases to assign conditions or extract content for reuse. The {subject domain} needs to annotate phrases to describe the subject the phrase refers to. 
        
        In planning your markup structures, therefore, it is important to think about which structures in your language need to be mixed content and which do not. Finding ways to avoid mixed content without violating the spirit of the essentially narrative nature of writing can pay dividends in an improved ability to express constraints and to execute virtually all the structured writing algorithms.
        
        On the other hand, some of the most important subject matter that you need to model and make available to algorithms cannot effectively be factored out of paragraphs, particularly while maintaining {functional lucidity}. Be prepared, therefore, to think seriously about the types of phrases that you need to annotate below the paragraph level and exactly which domain those annotations should be in.
