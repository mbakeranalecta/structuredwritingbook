    The overall goal of a content process is to create an effective information architecture. Information architecture is the arrangement of useful and effective content so it can be found and navigated. An artful arrangement of awful content helps no one; information architecture is rhetoric writ large.

    But the {rhetorical}+(index "rhetoric;information architecture and") nature of information architecture is often neglected. It is all too easy to think of information architecture simply in terms of organizing things. However, this can be a trap. Because institutions with a lot of content need a way for their staff to find content, information architecture often becomes an exercise in organizing content for the convenience of the institution rather than the reader.
    
    It is easy to think of organization is an absolute quality; content is either organized or not. But this is not so. Organization is an orientation of content according to your knowledge and expectations, which is to say that organization is a form of rhetoric, as specific to its audience as any other part of rhetoric. Readers consider things to be organized if the location of those things and the means of retrieving them match their expectations. However, what the institution (and its staff) knows and expects is different from what the reader knows and expects. What the institution sees as organization can be seen as chaos by the reader. 
    
    More than this, readers are unlikely to spend much mental energy trying to figure out a complex organizational scheme, even one that was designed with them in mind, unless they are already familiar with the scheme or, at least, it makes intuitive sense to them.  Instead, they will {forage for information}(concept "information foraging"), which, in the web world, means that they will use search and will follow links as long as they believe that the scent of the information they are looking for is growing stronger. For an in-depth treatment of {information foraging} and its implications for {information architecture}+(index "information architecture;information foraging and"), see {Every Page is Page One: Topic-based Writing for Technical Communication and the Web}(citetitle).
    
    It is a mistake, therefore, to think of information architecture simply in terms of organization. A building supply store organizes building materials. An architect takes those materials and constructs a navigable edifice full of useful spaces with efficient passages between them. The organization of materials offered by the building supply store is important to the architect, but it is just a starting point for the unique and useful edifice that the architect will design and build. 

    And for this reason, rhetoric is indispensable to information architecture. You can have good organization of bad material: you can have a neatly organized junk yard. But you cannot build a good edifice from bad materials. Architects are concerned as much with the quality of their materials as they are with the design that integrates them. One does not work without the other. You can't build a high quality car from junkyard parts. Information architecture is not, therefore, a wrapper around content, it is the rhetoric of the content set as a whole.

    section: Information architecture: past and present
    
        If there is a temptation to regard {information architecture}+(index "information architecture;past and present") as merely a form of organization, its origins may lie in the past. For centuries, the basic unit of information was the book and the architecture of the book was an integral part of the responsibility of the writer and editor. Larger sets of information were created by collecting and organizing books, and that was the responsibility of the librarian or bookseller. 
    
        Those larger collections were simply forms of organization. If there was an architecture at that scale, it came from the expertise of librarians and book sellers as they made inferences from their clients' needs and created useful connections. 
    
        With the advent of online media, first in the form of large capacity electronic media such as CD-ROMs and then the {web}, this division of responsibilities was overthrown. Now, the basic unit of information in electronic media is not the book but the page. Thanks to {hypertext} linking, the relationships between pages in electronic media are much more complex than on paper. Information architecture is a response to this challenge. 

        Information architect is not merely a new name for librarian but the integration of roles that were formerly divided or, rather, were the result of a different partitioning of responsibilities. Often the process changes required to support rhetoric will partition some content complexity away from writers and direct it to information architects. This doesn't just relieve writers of a burden, it also gives information architects visibility into and control over the rhetoric they need to do their job. This does not transfer all control of rhetoric from writers to information architects, because information architects do not have the intimate knowledge of the subject matter required to define rhetorical best practices for every type of content. Rather, it means that writers and information architects must work together to define and implement those best practices.
    
        Another way in which things are different today is that the architecture of online media has to support the ability to add, modify, and delete individual bits of content at any time. It is possible to think of book or library architectures in largely static terms. It is a serious mistake to think of web architectures as static. 

        This leads to the development of architectures composed of smaller units that have more complex relationships with a larger, more diverse, and more rapidly changing set of resources. These architectures include not only text and static graphics but active media: videos, animation, dynamic feeds, and information widgets.

        Given these factors, the old separation of roles between writer and librarian no longer works. Writers now have to be much more conscious of how their pages interact with other pages in the collection, including those created by others. The scale at which these small pieces of content relate with each other is much greater than the scale at which the pieces of a book related to each other. This constitutes a significant increase in complexity, which calls for a whole new approach to information architecture and for the appearance of a function and a role that had no equivalent in the paper world. 
    
        However, {information architecture}+(index "information architecture;print and its impact on") still needs to support paper delivery of content and to ensure that the design of content delivered on paper is as effective as it can be. In many cases, content delivered on paper will be the same content that was delivered on the web and will come from the same repository. However, if the roles of writer and information architect have been partitioned to support web output, responsibility for paper output is also likely to fall to the information architect, and structured writing algorithms such as {differential single sourcing} are likely to become an important part of the information architect's concerns. 

        As noted above, in many cases structured writing is used to transfer complexity from the writer to the information architect. It is the vast increase in the complexity of information architecture that makes this transfer necessary. But it also points out how much information needs to pass from the writer to the information architect, and vice versa, for both roles to do their jobs and not let any complexity slip through the cracks. Thus structured writing, which gives you a way to capture and pass on the required information consistently and reliably, becomes much more important in the current environment. Correct partitioning is essential to success in this area, and it cannot be achieved without the reliable transmission of information between roles that structured writing enables. 
        
    section: Top-down vs. bottom-up information architecture

        In looking at {information architecture}+(index "information architecture;top-down vs. bottom-up") as a form of rhetoric, it is useful to start by making a basic distinction between two types of information architecture: {top-down}(concept "top-down information architecture") and {bottom-up}(concept "bottom-up information architecture"). Top-down information architecture deals with navigational aids and organizing systems that stand apart from the content and point to it. A table of contents or a website menu system is a piece of top-down information architecture. Bottom-up information architecture deals with navigation and organization that exists within the content itself. A website with a consistent approach to {hypertext} {links} within its pages is an example of a bottom-up information architecture. 
        
        But {bottom-up information architecture} is not just about linking, it is about the way content is written. A page in a bottom-up information architecture is designed to be entered via search or links from almost anywhere (as opposed to being designed to be entered exclusively from a previous chapter). But it is also designed to help readers with onward navigation and to be a hub of its local subject space, offering readers many onward vectors according to their needs and interests. 

        This is a very different approach to information design because it makes {navigation}+(index "navigation;rhetorical design and") an integral part of the rhetoric of a document and the content set into which it is integrated. Linking is not an afterthought but part of the rhetorical design of the document. This is no longer an architecture in which navigation takes readers to content and leaves them there. Navigation and rhetoric are intertwined and continuous. 

        I call this approach to information design {Every Page is Page One}, and it is described in my book, {Every Page is Page One: Topic-based Writing for Technical Communication and the Web}(citetitle). One of the key principles of Every Page is Page One is that a {topic} should follow a well defined {rhetorical structure} or type. Structured writing, particularly subject-domain structured writing, is very useful in developing Every Page is Page One content. 
        
        Bottom-up and top-down information architectures are not incompatible with each other. In fact almost every information architecture has both top-down and bottom-up elements. (Books, for instance, which are principally top-down, based on a table of contents, may also have internal cross references, which are a bottom up mechanism.)
        
        Structured writing can be used to drive both the {top-down} and {bottom-up} aspects of information architecture.
