    Structured writing is a method for constraining and recording the structure of content to improve its rhetoric and manage the content creation process. Structure can be applied to content in several different domains. In this section, I introduce four domains of content structure, each with a fundamentally different approach to the relationship between process and rhetoric. Those domains are: media, document, subject, and management. 

    None of these domains is new. People have been using these approaches to markup for decades. Dividing these techniques into domains simply gives us a consistent way to talk about them and explore the virtues of each. Through the rest of the book I will show how choosing a markup language in each of these domains profoundly affects how you can manage process and rhetoric in your content system.

        Note\: The term _semantic_ is commonly used to characterize markup languages. Semantics is the study of meaning, so semantic markup is markup that tells us what the content means. Unfortunately, people can, and do, understand the phrase "semantic markup" in different ways, leading to confusion about what is and is not semantic markup. Therefore, I do not use the term semantic to describe markup languages, though I do use it in other contexts.
