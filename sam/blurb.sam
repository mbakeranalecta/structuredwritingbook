blurb:
    Structured writing has never been more important, or more confusing. We keep trying to do more and more with content and give ourselves less and less time to do it. Structured content can help keep our rhetoric on track and our processes efficient. But how does it do that and what is the relationship between rhetoric and process? 

    It is easy to get lost in sea of acronyms and buzz words: semantics, XML, metadata, DITA, structure, DocBook, hypertext, Markdown, topics, XSLT, reuse, LaTeX, silos, HTML. This book cuts through the noise, explaining what structured writing is (you have been doing it all along) and how different structures are used to achieve different purposes. It also focuses on the overall picture of how the complexity of the content creation process can be partitioned and managed using structured writing techniques to ensure that everything is handled by the person or process with the skills, time, and resources to handle it effectively. 

    Most importantly, this book shows you how the right structured writing techniques can improve the quality of your content and make your content process more efficient at the same time, without having to sacrifice quality for efficiency or vice versa. There are so many options available in the structured writing space today. This book will show you where each of them fits and help you choose the approach that is optimal for your content.
