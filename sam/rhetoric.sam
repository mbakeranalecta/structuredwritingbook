    The purpose of the content process is to produce good rhetoric. [#part.domains] described how structured writing can enforce, or factor out, certain rhetorical rules in your content, and it hinted at how you can use structured writing to improve process. Now, it is time to take a deeper dive into process and rhetoric and look at how structure supports them.

    Rhetoric is not just about how individual documents do their jobs. Documents are elements of a larger information set that serves a multitude of complex information needs. Organizing that larger information set is the domain of {information architecture}+(index "information architecture;rhetoric and"). Information architecture is a part of rhetoric, and the rhetoric of the information architecture has a direct impact on the rhetoric of individual documents. Thus, this part of the book looks at information architecture and the relationship between the rhetoric of documents and the rhetoric of information sets.

    Ultimately, rhetoric is the domain of the writer. Rhetoric is what writers do. Structured writing does not usurp the writer's role in rhetoric. Rather, writers use structured writing as a tool to create rhetoric with greater precision and consistency. Thus, this part concludes with a look at how a structured approach to rhetoric fits into the writing process.
