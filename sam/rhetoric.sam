    The purpose of the content process is to produce good rhetoric. In [#part.domains] we saw how structured writing can enforce of factor out certain rhetorical rules in your content and hinted at how it can be used to improve process. Now it is time to take a deeper dive into process and rhetoric, how structure supports them.

    Rhetoric is not just about how individual documents do their jobs, however. Documents are just elements of a larger information set that serves a multitude of complex information needs. The organization of that larger information set is the domain of information architecture. Information architecture is a part of rhetoric, and the rhetoric of the information architecture can have a direct impact on the rhetoric of individual documents. Thus this part takes a look at information architecture and the relationship between the rhetoric of documents and the rhetoric of information sets.

    Finally, rhetoric is, ultimately, the domain of the writer. Rhetoric is what writers do. Structured writing does not usurp the writer's role in rhetoric. Rather, structured writing is a tool for writers to use to exercise their function as creators of rhetoric with greater precision and consistency. Thus this part concludes with a look at how a structured approach to rhetoric fits into the writing process.
