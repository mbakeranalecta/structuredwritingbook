        concept, single sourcing

    The need to publish the same document in more than one medium -- for example, print and Web -- is a common source of complexity. We use the term _single sourcing_ to describe a variety of different ways to address this need, all of which involve using a single body of content to create output in more than one medium. I look at variations on this theme in this and subsequent chapters.

    Single sourcing adds complexity to the job of separating content from formatting because we are now separating content from not one but two or more sets of formatting. In other words, we are not simply separating content from formatting, we are separating a set of decisions about formatting from our content so that we can make different decisions for each medium. If you don't get the partitioning correct, problems will show up when you try to apply two different sets of formatting to the same content. 
    
    Many organizations have unhandled complexity in this area -- complexity that falls through to readers. Often, their authoring techniques do not allow writers to sufficiently separate media-specific formatting from content. As a result, formatting for one medium gets applied to another medium, which means the content in that medium does not work as well as it could. By improving how we separate content from formatting,  we can significantly reduce the amount of complexity that goes unhandled, resulting in a better experience for our readers.  
    
    section: Basic single sourcing 
    
        The basic single-sourcing algorithm is straightforward; we covered most of it in [#chapter.processing]. Basic single sourcing involves taking a piece of content in the {document domain}(concept) and processing its document-domain structures into different {media-domain}(concept) structures for each target medium. 
        
        Suppose we have recorded a recipe in the document domain (see [*fig.ssa-eggs-1]).

                            li: Remove from heat and cover for 12 minutes.
                            li: Place eggs in cold water to stop cooking.
                            li: Peel and serve.
        
               
        We can output this recipe to two different media by applying two different formatting algorithms. First we output to the Web by creating {HTML} (see [*fig.ssa-recipe2html]).

        In [*fig.ssa-recipe2html], paragraph and list structures have the same names in the source format as they do in the output format (HTML) so we just copy the structures rather than recreating them. This is a common pattern in structured writing algorithms.
        
        The algorithm in [*fig.ssa-recipe2html] transforms our source into HTML that looks like [*fig.ssa-html-recipe-output].

        Outputting to paper (or to PDF, which is a kind of virtual paper) is more complex. On the Web, you output to a screen which is of flexible width and infinite length. The browser wraps lines of text to the screen width (unless formatting commands tell it to do otherwise), and there is no issue with breaking text from one page to another. For paper, however, you have to fit content into a set of fixed-size pages.   
        
        This introduces a number of formatting issues, including the following:
        
        * Where to break each line of text so the margins look neat and the text is not cramped or spread out too much. 
        * How to avoid placing a heading at the bottom of a page or the last line of a paragraph as the first line of a page.
        * How to handle a list or a table when you run out of space on the page.
        * How to create a cross reference to another page when you don't know the page number yet.
        
        Because of issues like this, you don't write a formatting algorithm for paper directly, the way you would write an algorithm to output HTML. Instead, you use an intermediate typesetting system that already knows how to handle tasks such as inserting page-number references and handling line and page breaks. Rather than handling these things yourself, you give the typesetting system general guidance and then let it do its job.

        One such typesetting system is {XSL-FO}(language) (Extensible Stylesheet Language - Formatting Objects). Other typesetting systems include {TeX}(language) and newer versions of {CSS}(language). XSL-FO is a typesetting language written in {XML}(language). To format your content using {XSL-FO}, you transform your source content into {XSL-FO} markup, just the way you transform it into {HTML}(language) for the Web. But then you run the {XSL-FO} markup through an {XSL-FO} processor to produce your final output, typically {PDF}(language). 
        
        Here is a small example of XSL-FO markup:
        
        ```(XSL-FO)
            <fo:block space-after="4pt">
               <fo:wrapper font-size="14pt" font-weight="bold">
                 Hard Boiled Eggs
               </fo:wrapper>
            </fo:block>
        
        
        The {XSL-FO} code contains {media-domain}(concept) instructions for spacing and font choices. There is no division between content structures and formatting structures as there is with {HTML}(language) and {CSS}(language). Also, as a pure media-domain language, XSL-FO does not have document-domain structures such as paragraphs and titles. To XSL-FO, a document is simply a set of blocks with specific formatting properties attached to them.
        
        To limit the amount of detail, the algorithm in [*fig.ssa-fo-algorithm] shows only a portion of the pseudocode for handling recipe markup (The point here is not to teach {XSL-FO}, but to show how the algorithm works).

        figure:(*fig.ssa-fo-algorithm) Portion of the algorithm to generate XSL-FO from a recipe
            ```(pseudo)
                match title
                    output '<fo:block space-after="4pt">'
                        output '<fo:wrapper font-size="14pt" font-weight="bold">'
                            continue
                        output '</fo:wrapper>'
                    output '</fo:block>'
        
        The rule shown in [*fig.ssa-fo-algorithm] simply wraps the XSL-FO formatting structures around the text of the title. It unpacks the text from a {document-domain} structure and inserts it into a {media-domain} structure. 
        
        
    section: Differential single sourcing
    
        Basic {single sourcing} outputs the same document presentation to different media. However, each medium is different, and what works well in one medium does not always work as well in another. For example, online media generally support {hypertext}(concept) links, while paper does not. Let's suppose that we have a piece of content that includes a link:
        
        ```
            In Rio Bravo, {the Duke}(link "http://JohnWayne.com")
            plays an ex-Union colonel out for revenge.
        
        
        In SAM syntax, the link markup (`link "http://JohnWayne.com`) specifies the address to link to. In the algorithm examples below, I refer to this markup as the _specifically_ attribute using the notation `@specifically`.
        
        In HTML, we output this as a link using the HTML `a` element, so the algorithm looks like [*fig.ssa-specifically-1].

        figure:(*fig.ssa-specifically-1) Algorithm to generate HTML link from the `@specifically` attribute
        
            ```
                match p
                    copy
                        continue
                
                match link
                    create a
                        attribute href = @specifically 
                        continue
        
           
            The result of this algorithm is:
            
            ```(html)
                <p>In Rio Bravo, <a href="http://JohnWayne.com">The Duke</a>
                plays and ex-Union colonel out for revenge.
                </p>
        
        
        But suppose we want to output this same content to paper. If we output it to PDF, we can still create a link as with HTML, but when that PDF is printed, all that's left is a slight color change in the text and maybe an underline. Readers cannot follow the link. 
        
        You can't print an active link on paper, but you can print the URL, so the reader can type it into a browser. Your algorithm can print the link inline or as a footnote. [*fig.ssa-specifically-2] shows the algorithm for printing the URL inline. (I dispense with the detailed XSL-FO syntax this time.)

        figure:(*fig.ssa-specifically-2) Algorithm to display the URL for a link in print
        
            ```(pseudo)
                match p
                    create fo:block
                        continue
                        
                match link
                    continue
                    output " (see: "
                    output @specifically
                    output ") "
            
            This will produce:
            
            ```(xml)
                <fo:block>
                In Rio Bravo, the Duke (see: http://JohnWayne.com) 
                plays an ex-Union colonel out for revenge.
                </fo:block>
          
        
        This works, but note that the effect is not the same in each medium. Online, the link to JohnWayne.com disambiguates the phrase "The Duke" for those readers who do not recognize it. A simple click on the link will explain who "the Duke" is. But in the paper example, such disambiguation exists only incidentally, because the words "JohnWayne" happen to appear in the URL. This is not how we would disambiguate "The Duke" if we were writing for paper. We would be more likely to do something like this:
        
        """
            The Duke (John Wayne) plays an ex-Union colonel.

        This provides readers with less information, in the sense that it does not give them access to all the information on JohnWayne.com, but it does a better job of disambiguation and in a more paper-like way. The loss of the reference to JohnWayne.com is probably not an issue here. Following that link by typing it into a browser is a lot more work than simply clicking on a Web link. Someone who wants more information on John Wayne is far more likely to type "John Wayne" into Google than type "JohnWayne.com" into the browser address bar.   
        
        As written, the source content provides no easy way to produce this preferred form for paper. The content is in the {document domain}(concept), which specifies the presentation of the content. Therefore, it is not a neutral format between media that require different forms of presentation. The choice to specify a link directly in the markup gives it a strong bias towards the Web and online media rather than paper. A {document-domain} approach that favored paper would similarly lead to a poorer online presentation by omitting the link. 
        
        We need a _differential_ approach to single sourcing, one that allows us to differ not only the formatting but the presentation of the content for different media.
        
        One way to accomplish differential single sourcing is to record the content in the {subject domain}(concept), thus removing the prejudice of the document-domain presentation for one medium or another. Here is how this markup might look:
        
        ```(sam)
            {The Duke}(actor "John Wayne") plays an ex-Union colonel.
        
        
        In this example, the phrase "The Duke" is annotated with subject-domain markup that clarifies exactly what the text refers to. That annotation says that "the Duke" is the name of an actor, specifically John Wayne.
             
        Our document-domain examples attempted to clarify "the Duke" for readers, but they did so in media-dependent ways. This subject-domain example clarifies the meaning of "The Duke" in a presentation-neutral way; it explicitly, formally, and unambigously marks up what the phrase refers to. This markup is written for algorithms, not readers. It allows an algorithm to generate an appropriate clarification for the reader in any target medium (see [*fig.ssa-specifically-3]). 

        figure:(*fig.ssa-specifically-3) Algorithm to render paper and Web links from subject-domain markup
      
            For paper:
            
            ```
                match actor
                    continue
                    output " ("
                    output @specifically
                    output ") "
                        
            For the Web:
            
            ```
                match actor
                    create link
                        $href = get link for actor named @specifically
                        attribute href = $href
                        continue
        
        
        This assumes the existence of a system that can respond to the `get link` instruction and look up pages to link to based on the type and a name of a subject. I look at such a system in [#chapter.linking], which revisits this example in more detail.  
        
    section: Differential organization and presentation
    
        Differences in presentation between media can be broader than this. Paper documents sometimes use complex tables and elaborate layouts that don't translate well to online media. Effective table layout depends on knowing the width of the page you have available, and online you don't know that. A table that looks great on paper may be unreadable on a mobile device, for instance. 
        
        And this is more than a layout issue. Sometimes the things that paper does in a static way should be done dynamically in online media. For example, airline and train schedules have traditionally been printed as timetables on paper, but you rarely see them presented that way online. Rather, you see an interactive travel planner that lets you choose your starting point, destination, and desired travel times and then presents you with the best schedule, including when and where to make connections. If your single source is a timetable designed for print and PDF, you can't produce the kind of online presentation of your schedule that people expect, and that can have a direct impact on your business.
        
        To single source schedule information for both paper and online media, you can't maintain that content in a document-domain table structure. You need to maintain it in a timetable database structure (which is in the {subject domain}, even though it looks like a database, not a document). 
        
        An algorithm can read such a database to generate a document-domain table for print publication. For the Web, however, you can create a web application that queries the same database dynamically to calculate routes and schedules for individual travelers. 
        
        # pix of timetable and routing widget ???

        In this scenario, you move content to the {subject domain} to partition the presentation from the information, which allows you to produce a different information design for different media (see [*ex.ssa-differential]). I examine these scenarios in more depth in [#chapter.wide]. 
        
        figure:(*ex.ssa-differential) Information design for single sourcing
            >>>(image ../graphics/Differential.xml)
        
        
    section: Conditional differential design
    
        You can also do differential single sourcing by using conditional {management-domain} structures in the document domain.
       
        For instance, if you are writing a manual that you intend to single source to a help system, you might want to add context setting information to the start of a section when it appears in the help system. The manual may be designed to be read sequentially, meaning that the context of individual sections is established by what came before. But help systems are always accessed randomly, meaning that the context of a particular help topic may not be clear if it was single sourced from a manual. To accommodate this, you could include a context-setting paragraph that is conditionalized to appear only in help output (see [*ex.ssa-conditional-1]):

        figure:(*ex.ssa-conditional-1) Differential single source example using management-domain structures
            ```(sam)
                section: Wrangling left-handed widgets
                
                    ~~~(?help-only)
                    
                        Left-handed widgets are used when wrangling 
                        counter-clockwise.
                        
                    To wrangle a left handed widget:
                    
                    1. Loosen the doohickey using a medium thingamabob.
                    2. Spin three times around under a full moon.
                    3. Touch the sky.            
        

        In [*ex.ssa-conditional-1], the SAM markup `~~~` creates a fragment structure to which conditional tokens can be applied. Content indented under the fragment marker is part of the fragment.
        
        To output a manual, we suppress the help-only content:
        
        ```(pseudo)

    section: Primary and secondary media
        
        While differential single sourcing can help you output documents that work well in multiple media, there are limits to how far this approach can take you. 
        
        Books are a linear medium in which one chapter follows another in order. The Web is a {hypertext} medium in which every page is page one. Readers arrive at a page via search, and they navigate by following hypertext links. The linear and hypertext approaches are fundamentally different ways of writing that invite fundamentally different ways of navigating and using information.[*eppo] Even moving content to the {subject domain} as much as possible will not entirely factor out these fundamental differences in approach. 

        footnote:(*eppo)
            For a full examination of the differences, see my book {Every Page is Page One: Topic-based Writing for Technical Communication and the Web}(citetitle "Baker2013").
        
        When single sourcing content to both linear paper-like media and {hypertext} web-like media, you generally have to choose a primary medium. Single sourcing that content to other media will be on a best-effort basis. It may be good enough for a particular purpose, but it will never be as good as it could have been had you designed exclusively for that medium.
        
        Many of the tools used for single sourcing have a built-in bias towards one medium or another. Desktop-publishing tools such as {FrameMaker}(tool), for instance, were designed for linear media. Online collaborative tools such as {wikis}(tool) were designed for {hypertext} media. It is usually a good idea to pick a tool that was designed for the medium you choose as primary. Tools partition the complexity of content creation to best suit the primary medium they were designed for. 
        
        Often, the tools a group uses implicitly determine the primary medium. This usually means that the primary medium is paper, and paper often continues to be primary even after the organization stops producing paper, and their readers have moved to online formats. 
        
        Some organizations think they should not switch to tools that are designed primarily for online content until they have entirely abandoned paper and paper-like formats such as PDF. This certainly does not need to be the case. It is perfectly possible to switch to online-primary tools and still produce linear media as a secondary output format. 
        
        Changing your information design practices from linear, paper-based designs to {hypertext} designs is not trivial, but such designs better suit the way many people use and access content today. I discuss these design differences in depth in my book, {Every Page is Page One: Topic-based Writing for Technical Communication and the Web}(citetitle) Don't expect single sourcing, by itself, to successfully turn document-oriented design into effective hypertext. It is usually more effective to adopt an {Every Page is Page One}(concept) approach to information design and use structured writing and single-sourcing techniques as a best-effort method to create linear media for those of your readers who still need paper or paper-like formats -- or for those documents where linear organization still makes sense. 
        
    section: Responsive Design
    
        Responsive design is an approach to web design that attempts to automatically adjust a page to fit any size of display, from desktop monitors to small smartphone screens. Responsive design is a form of differential single sourcing.
        
        Often, responsive design is not as responsive as possible because the content is not stored in a source format that allows a sufficient degree of differential presentation. Effectively, responsive design allows an algorithm to decide on the fly how to organize and present content as the viewport changes. A responsive-design algorithm is only as good as the information communicated to it. {Subject-domain} structures are enormously helpful in capturing and transferring the information algorithms need to display effective and consistent on-the-fly responsive output.

        !!!(RLH)
            I'm not 100% convinced by your line of thought in the next paragraph. I don't see a clear chain from "having to respond to new media," to "every sound responsive-design decision depends on the appropriate organization of subject matter" to "the rules of effective responsive design are going to be expressed in subject-matter terms." I think you need to be clearer about that chain of thought.
            
        It is difficult for writers to encode the presentation structures of a responsive design as they write. In addition, responsive design should take into account the possibility of having to respond to new media in the future. Every sound responsive-design decision depends the appropriate organization of subject matter in a particular view port. Therefore, the rules of effective responsive design are going to be expressed in subject matter terms. The best way to create content that will presented using responsive design, therefore, is in the {subject domain} where the subject-matter divisions you use to express responsive-design rules are explicit in the content. I look at this in more depth in [#chapter.active].
