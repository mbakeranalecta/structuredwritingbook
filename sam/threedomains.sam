    Structured writing is an approach to content creation that can help you improve both your rhetoric and your process. To understand how structured writing can help, let's begin by looking at how content gets from ideas in a head to dots on a page or screen. 
    
    section: From ideas to dots

        The process of creating and delivering content consists of translating ideas (stuff someone thinks or knows) into a form that can be read (dots of ink on a page, or pixels on a screen).

        Structured writing applies a structured methodology to that process. It is a long road from ideas to dots, and structured writing techniques can be applied at many points along that road. Almost all writing done today uses structured writing techniques to one extent or another. The principles of structured writing apply across the spectrum, from the tools and techniques used in most offices today to the most sophisticated structured writing systems.
        
        All writing has structure in the linguistic sense of the word. Every comprehensible sentence has a grammatical structure. You may even have learned to diagram that structure in school.[*fn.sentence]

        Just as all writing has at least a basic grammatical structure, all writing on a computer involves creating basic data structures. Thus, the only case in which no structured writing techniques are involved in the writing process is when an author writes down ideas with pen and paper and gives that paper directly to the reader. In this case, the entire writing process, from an idea to words on paper, takes place in the writer's head and hands.
        
        >>>(image ../graphics/ideas2dotsrecordend.xml) 

        Writers rarely record their ideas directly in the final physical form these days. For instance, the writer may write in a word processor, edit the text on screen, and press {Print}(guibutton) to send the content to a printer or {Send}(guibutton) to have the content rendered on a monitor. The point, along the journey from ideas to dots, where content is recorded has moved back just a little bit.
        
        >>>(image ../graphics/ideas2dotsrecordmid.xml) 

        Word processing, desktop publishing, and various approaches to structured writing all establish a point between ideas and dots where the content will be recorded and then provide algorithms to complete the journey from that point to dots on a page.

        We can describe this process of earlier recording in terms of three domains, each domain reflecting a stage in the progress from ideas to dots. The domains are the media domain (which is concerned with lines and dots on paper or screen), the document domain (which is concerned with the expression and organization of documents), and the subject domain (which is concerned with the subject matter that we write about). 
        
 
    section: The three domains

        Let's suppose you want to write a recipe for chicken noodle soup. You start out with the idea of a soup made with chicken and noodles. This is an idea about the subject matter and not yet any form of content. 

        >>>(image ../graphics/soup1.xml)

        You then decide to name the dish “Chicken Noodle Soup.” You figure out which ingredients to use and how to make the dish. This is all information about making chicken noodle soup but it is not yet part of a document. You have not yet made any rhetorical decisions about how to communicate this information effectively. It is information in the {subject}+(italic) domain.  
        
        >>>(image ../graphics/soup2.xml)

        Then, you decide how to present this information to help other people make Chicken Noodle Soup. You decide to have a title, a picture, an introduction, a list of ingredients, and a set of preparation steps. At this point, you are no longer gathering information, you are focused on presenting the information you have gathered, applying a specific rhetoric to your information. These are decisions in the {document}+(italic) domain. Documents are how we organize and present information. (As we will see, however, some document types, such as recipes, are specific to a particular subject, and there is considerable overlap between document and subject domain considerations in their design, which may or may not be reflected in how they are recorded.)

        >>>(image ../graphics/soup3.xml)

        Then, you consider how the document will look on screen or on paper. What font will you use for the heading and the body text. How large will the heading and the body be. Will the quantity of the ingredients be flush right? Will there be leading dots? Will the presentation steps be numbered or just presented sequentially?  How big will the picture be? Will the text wrap around it? These are decision in the {media}+(italic) domain. 
        
        >>>(image ../graphics/soup4.xml)
       
        All content passes through the three domains. Content always begins with thinking about subjects in the real world. You decide to express ideas about those subjects in words. You collect those ideas and determine an order and structure to express them. Finally, you decide how they will be formatted in a particular medium. The question is, where in this process do you start recording the content? 
        
        Do you format your content as you write? Then you are working in the media domain. 
        
        >>>(image ../graphics/soup5.xml)
        
        
        Do you record presentation units such as lists, headings, and steps without associating formatting? Then you are working in the document domain. 
        
        
        >>>(image ../graphics/soup6.xml)
        
        Do you record the raw information as data, for instance, identifying ingredients as ingredients and quantity as quantities, rather than as list items? Then you are working in the subject domain. 
        
        
        >>>(image ../graphics/soup7.xml)
        
        If you recorded your content in the media domain, it is ready to publish. 
        
        
        >>>(image ../graphics/soup8.xml)
        
        If you recorded it in the document domain, then it needs to be formatted for each target medium before it can be published. This is done by an algorithm that translates the document domain structures and into the appropriate media domain structures for the target media.
        
        
        >>>(image ../graphics/soup9.xml)
        
        If you recorded it in the subject domain, then it needs to be organized into a document before it can be published. This is done by an algorithm that translates the subject domain structures into the appropriate document domain structures for the intended document.
                
        >>>(image ../graphics/soup10.xml)

        This does not mean that a structured writing system is always wholly in one domain. In fact, that is more the exeption than the rule. Most systems are hybrids with structures from more than one domain, or structured that themselves have a foot in more than one domain. However, the differences between how things work in each of the domains is significant and identifying which domain you are working in at any given time will help you understand what is possible, and to determine if moving to a different domain might make your process or rhetoric better. 

              
        At the beginning of this section I described the three domains in terms of the decisions that must be made in each domain. All of these decisions, from all three domains, have to be made for every document that you produce. When you record content in the media domain, you make decisions in all three domains as you write. When you record content in the document domain, you make decisions in the subject and document domains and defer media-domain decisions to algorithms. When you record content in the subject domain, you make decisions in the subject domain and defer document- and media-domain decisions to algorithms. 

        Recording content earlier in the process reduces the number of decisions you have to make while writing (reducing the complexity of the writing task), while preserving the ability to make different decisions later. This shift can have profound effects on the efficiency of your process and the usefulness of your content. 

        That is the promise of structured writing. However, it is not always as clear and simple as that makes it sound, since structured writing introduces decision-making requirements and, therefore, complexity of its own. The next three chapters look at what it is like to write in each domain. In [#part.algorithms] and [#part.structures] we will look at the sources of complexity in structured writing itself and how best to manage them.
