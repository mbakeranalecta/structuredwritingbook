    Now that we have examined the structured writing algorithms it is time to look at structures. While we have looked as specific structures that directly support particular algorithms, once you decide to adopt structured writing, all your content has to be expressed in structures. This creates issues with representation and functional lucidity which I will examine in this section, looking once again at how the approaches of the different domains are different, and the difference that makes to process, rhetoric, and {functional lucidity}.
