This creates issues with representation and functional lucidity which I will examine in this section, looking once again at how the approaches of the different domains are different, and the difference that makes to process, rhetoric, and <db:indexterm><db:primary>functional lucidity</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>concept</db:primary><db:secondary>functional lucidity</db:secondary></db:indexterm>functional lucidity.</db:para>
