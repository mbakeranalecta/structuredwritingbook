<db:para>As soon as we start to create document that run across more than one page, working purely in the media domain starts to present complex pagination issues. Pagination is a complex process, one requiring a lot of decisions about how and where to break, and it is tedious and time consuming to execute those decisions by hand. These are all decisions that an algorithm can make, but do hand them off to the algorithm, we need to move our content into the document domain.</db:para>
<db:para>The <db:indexterm><db:primary>document domain</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>concept</db:primary><db:secondary>document domain</db:secondary></db:indexterm>document domain is concerned with the presentation of information as a document. In the document domain you use structures such as title, list, and table, without specifying how they will be formatted. You make document-domain decisions and defer media-domain decisions to someone else. In all likelihood, you defer those decisions to a designer who creates an algorithm to execute the decision.</db:para>
<db:sidebar>
<db:title>Formatting versus presentation</db:title>
<db:para>The words <db:emphasis>formatting</db:emphasis> and <db:emphasis>presentation</db:emphasis> are commonly used as synonyms, but here I make a distinction between, for example, the decision to present a piece of information as a list (presentation), and the decision to format list items in 12-point Palatino with 1-em indent and a square bullet (formatting). In this sense, presentation and formatting are distinct and can be partitioned from each other. However, it’s easy to lose this distinction because most of today’s tools combine these two operations in a <db:indexterm><db:primary>WYSIWYG</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>concept</db:primary><db:secondary>WYSIWYG</db:secondary></db:indexterm>WYSIWYG display.</db:para>
</db:sidebar>
<db:para>Word processors and desktop publishing programs partition the pagination process from the writing process by introducing some document domain constraints. A document is made up of a series of pages that have margins and contain text flows. Text flows are made up of blocks (paragraphs, headings) inside of which text can flow, even from one page to the next. Common features like tables are supported as objects than can exist in text flows. New pages are created automatically as text expands. In other words, the application creates a bunch of text containers and manages the basic decisions about how to fit text into those containers. This leaves authors free to focus on writing and leave pagination decisions to the program.</db:para>
<db:para>Pages, paragraphs, headings, and tables, are all <db:indexterm><db:primary>document domain</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>concept</db:primary><db:secondary>document domain</db:secondary></db:indexterm>document domain objects. Rather than working on a blank slate, as you do in a graphics program, the writer is now working within the <db:indexterm><db:primary>constraints</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>concept</db:primary><db:secondary>constraints</db:secondary></db:indexterm>constraints of these document domain objects.  These constraints remove or constrain decisions about positioning of elements, which makes creating documents faster and more consistent. Structured writing is about making content that obeys constraints, and these basic document domain constraints are the next step in that journey.</db:para>
<db:para>However, word processors and desktop-publishing applications don’t represent a complete move into the document domain. Rather, they straddle the media domain and the document domain. While they offer a basic set of document-domain objects – pages, paragraphs, tables, and so forth – they use a <db:indexterm><db:primary>WYSIWYG</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>concept</db:primary><db:secondary>WYSIWYG</db:secondary></db:indexterm>WYSIWYG display, which unifies, rather than partitions, writing and formatting. This keeps the writer thinking mostly in terms of styles and formatting – the concerns of the media domain – and makes it difficult to apply meaningful document-domain constraints or to record which constraints the writer has followed. This makes it impossible to redistribute formatting complexity entirely from the writer. For that you need to move more fully into the document domain where we can take the formatting decisions out of the writer’s hands entirely.</db:para>
<db:para>Taking the formatting decisions out of the writer’s hand obviously reduce the complexity of the writer’s task, since they no longer have to make formatting decisions. But by moving those decisions away from writers, we also ensure that they are executed more consistently. All of the media domain constraints – all the design elements – that we previously asked writers to remember and execute, are not executed by an algorithm. This means that we can now enforce media-domain constraints that were difficult to enforce in the media domain itself.</db:para>
<db:para>This illustrates a consistent pattern in structured writing: we often move to the next domain to enforce – or factor out – constraints in the previous domain. This is an important design principle that we will see several times as we look at the structured writing algorithms. Wherever possible, look for a way to factor out a constraint rather than enforce it. Enforcing a constraint still requires the writer to think and act. Factoring it out removes it from the writer’s concerns entirely.</db:para>
<db:remark>MB - 
I pulled the above out of the footnote and expanded on it. It is not an incidental remark but a key design principle.
</db:remark>
<db:para>Consider a list. You may want the spacing above the first item of a list to be different from the spacing between other items of the list. This is a media-domain constraint – it is about formatting, not the structure of the document. However, this constraint is hard to enforce in the media domain.</db:para>
<db:para>Most media-domain writing applications create lists by applying styles to ordinary paragraphs. To format a list with an extra space above the first item, you need to create two different styles: a <db:code>first-item-of-list</db:code> style and and <db:code>following-item-of-list</db:code> style. The result might look like <db:xref linkend="ex.flat-list"/>.</db:para>
<db:figure xml:id="ex.flat-list"><db:title>List structure in the media domain</db:title><db:programlisting>
p{first-item-of-list}: Carrots
p{following-item-of-list}: Celery
p{following-item-of-list}: Onions
</db:programlisting></db:figure>
<db:para>This requires the writer to apply the <db:code>first-item-of-list</db:code> style to the first item of a list and the <db:code>following-item-of-list</db:code> style to the following items. The word processor does not enforce this constraint. The writer has to remember it, which creates two problems:</db:para>
<db:orderedlist>
<db:listitem>
<db:para>It makes writing a bit harder (and all the bits add up). The writer needs to decide which style to use for every list item, even though the design decision has already been made. And new writers must learn, and remember to apply, this rule.</db:para>
</db:listitem>
<db:listitem>
<db:para>If the writer gets it wrong, the problem can easily go unnoticed.</db:para>
</db:listitem>
</db:orderedlist>
<db:para>Structured writing works by factoring out invariants. Most constraints are invariants – that is, they are rules that apply to all instances of the same content structure. The constraint that all lists must have extra space before the first item is an obvious example. The best way to enforce an invariant constraint is to partition it out altogether.</db:para>
<db:para>To do this, we create a list structure – not a styled paragraph, but a structure that is specifically a list. A document-domain list structure looks like <db:xref linkend="ex.docdomain-list"/>:</db:para>
<db:figure xml:id="ex.docdomain-list"><db:title>List structure in the document domain</db:title><db:programlisting language="SAM">
list:
    list-item: Carrots
    list-item: Celery
    list-item: Onions
</db:programlisting></db:figure>
<db:para>A list structure partitions the idea of a list from the physical formatting of a list by creating a container that did not exist before – the <db:code>list</db:code> structure. By creating a <db:code>list</db:code> structure, the writer tells the formatting algorithm that this is a list. Since a list is a feature of a document, it is a document-domain structure. The <db:code>list</db:code> container has no media-domain analog.</db:para>
<db:para>Once you have a <db:code>list</db:code> structure, you can create rules – in a separate file – about how lists are formatted. We are familiar with this from <db:indexterm><db:primary>HTML</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>language</db:primary><db:secondary>HTML</db:secondary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>HTML</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>standard</db:primary><db:secondary>HTML</db:secondary></db:indexterm>HTML and <db:indexterm><db:primary>cascading style sheets</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>language</db:primary><db:secondary>cascading style sheets</db:secondary></db:indexterm>CSS. <db:xref linkend="ex.html-list"/> shows a list structure in <db:indexterm><db:primary>HTML</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>language</db:primary><db:secondary>HTML</db:secondary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>HTML</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>standard</db:primary><db:secondary>HTML</db:secondary></db:indexterm>HTML (actually, this is a slightly more specific structure, but we’ll get to that):</db:para>
<db:figure xml:id="ex.html-list"><db:title>List structure using HTML</db:title><db:programlisting language="HTML">

    &lt;li&gt;Carrots&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Celery&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Onions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
</db:programlisting></db:figure>
<db:para>Now that you have a distinct list object, you can factor out the invariant list formatting rule into a separate file. For <db:indexterm><db:primary>HTML</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>language</db:primary><db:secondary>HTML</db:secondary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>HTML</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>standard</db:primary><db:secondary>HTML</db:secondary></db:indexterm>HTML, we usually do this with a <db:indexterm><db:primary>cascading style sheets</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>language</db:primary><db:secondary>cascading style sheets</db:secondary></db:indexterm>CSS stylesheet (see <db:xref linkend="ex.css-list"/>):</db:para>
<db:figure xml:id="ex.css-list"><db:title>CSS for a list structure</db:title><db:programlisting language="CSS">

</db:programlisting></db:figure>
<db:para>This factors out the spacing-above-lists decision and assigns it to an algorithm, partitioning the complexity of list formatting by asking the author to express a simple idea in familiar terms – this is a list – instead of executing a complex set of formatting instructions.</db:para>
<db:para>Introducing the concept of a list structure adds to the total complexity of the system and requires authors to manage a little extra complexity. However, in return, a much larger piece of complexity has been partitioned off and assigned to an algorithm, reducing the number of decisions authors must make and ensuring a greater degree of consistency.</db:para>
<db:para>But wait! That’s fine if you format all lists exactly the same way, but that is not true. At the very least, some lists are bulleted and some are numbered. And then there are nested lists, which are formatted differently from their parents, and specialized lists, such as lists of ingredients, definitions, or function parameters. How do you make sure each type of list gets formatted appropriately?</db:para>
<db:para>A word processor or desktop publishing application addresses this problem using styles. You can create a style for each type of list formatting you want. A document domain environment must make similar provision for different types of lists. However, the document domain deal with presentation (this is a list), not formatting (this paragraph starts with a bullet and a tab and is in 12pt New Century Schoolbook). So the questions becomes, how may different kinds of list presentations do we need to support.</db:para>
<db:para>One obvious presentation difference between lists is that some are express an ordered sequence of items while others present simply a collection of items with no necessary order to them. We generally format these as numbered and bulleted lists respectively, but here we want to express the presentation difference, not the formatting difference.</db:para>
<db:para>The common way to handle this is to create two different list structures, the ordered list and the unordered list. Different markup languages call them by different names – <db:indexterm><db:primary>ol</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>structure</db:primary><db:secondary>ol</db:secondary></db:indexterm>ol and <db:indexterm><db:primary>ul</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>structure</db:primary><db:secondary>ul</db:secondary></db:indexterm>ul in HTML, <db:indexterm><db:primary>orderedlist</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>structure</db:primary><db:secondary>orderedlist</db:secondary></db:indexterm>orderedlist and <db:indexterm><db:primary>itemized-list</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>structure</db:primary><db:secondary>itemized-list</db:secondary></db:indexterm>itemized-list in DocBook, for example – but they are conceptually the same thing. (Thus the HTML example above is a little more specific than just being a list structure. It is an ordered list structure.)</db:para>
<db:para>The choice of the terms “unordered” and “ordered” is important, because it focuses on the <db:indexterm><db:primary>document-domain</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>concept</db:primary><db:secondary>document-domain</db:secondary></db:indexterm>document-domain properties of a list – whether its order matters – rather than on its <db:indexterm><db:primary>media domain</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>concept</db:primary><db:secondary>media domain</db:secondary></db:indexterm>media domain properties – bullets or numbers. Whether an ordered list should be formatted with numbers or letters or Roman numerals, belongs entirely to the <db:indexterm><db:primary>media domain</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>concept</db:primary><db:secondary>media domain</db:secondary></db:indexterm>media domain. It has been partitioned out of the <db:indexterm><db:primary>document domain</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>concept</db:primary><db:secondary>document domain</db:secondary></db:indexterm>document domain structures.</db:para>
<db:section>
<db:title>Context and structure</db:title>
<db:para>Does the need for separate ordered and unordered list objects imply that you need a separate document-domain list structure for every possible way a list might be formatted? No. In fact, that would really just be working in the media domain by proxy. When you work in the document domain, you think in terms of document structures, not formatting, which means that each document-domain object must make sense in the document domain, not the media domain. Otherwise, the partitioning falls apart.</db:para>
<db:para>For example, consider nested lists. Items in a nested list are formatted differently from the list that contains them. At a minimum, they are indented more and they usually have different number or bullet styles. In the <db:indexterm><db:primary>media domain</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>concept</db:primary><db:secondary>media domain</db:secondary></db:indexterm>media domain, you would need a different style for each level. However, you don’t need a separate nested list structure in the <db:indexterm><db:primary>document domain</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>concept</db:primary><db:secondary>document domain</db:secondary></db:indexterm>document domain. Instead, you express nesting by actually nesting one list inside another. For instance, in <db:xref linkend="ex.nested-list"/> one ordered list is nested inside another ordered list:</db:para>
<db:figure xml:id="ex.nested-list"><db:title>Nested list structure in HTML</db:title><db:programlisting language="HTML">

        &lt;ol&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Spot&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Rover&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Fang&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Fluffy&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cats&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ol&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Mittens&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Tobermory&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

In the <db:indexterm><db:primary>media domain</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>concept</db:primary><db:secondary>media domain</db:secondary></db:indexterm>media domain, one will be formatted with Arabic numerals and the other with letters (see <db:xref linkend="ex.nested-list-rendered"/>).</db:para>

<db:para>Both the inner and outer lists are ordered lists in the document domain, but in the media domain they are formatted differently based on context.</db:para>
<db:para>In this case, the algorithm that formats the page distinguishes the inner and outer lists by looking at their parents. For instance, <db:xref linkend="ex.nested-css"/> shows a CSS rule for a list item nested one deep:</db:para>
<db:figure xml:id="ex.nested-css"><db:title>CSS for nested list items</db:title><db:programlisting language="css">
ol&gt;li&gt;ol&gt;li
{
    list-style-type: lower-alpha;
}
</db:programlisting></db:figure>
<db:para>The ability to distinguish structures by context enables you to reduce the number of structures you need to define, particularly in the document and subject domains. It also allows you to name structures more logically and intuitively, since you can name them for what they are, not how they are to be formatted or for where they reside in the hierarchy of the document.</db:para>
<db:para>It also points out another important difference between the way media-domain and document-domain writing is usually implemented. The media domain almost always uses a flat structure with paragraphs, tables, etc., following each other in sequence. For instance, Microsoft Word constructs a nested list as a flat sequence of paragraphs with different styles. Inner and outer lists are expressed purely by the indent applied to the paragraphs. (Word tries to maintain auto-numbering across nested list structures, but it does not always get it right.)</db:para>
<db:para>Document-domain structures are usually implemented hierarchically. List items are <db:emphasis>inside</db:emphasis> lists. Nested lists are <db:emphasis>inside</db:emphasis> list items. Sections are <db:emphasis>inside</db:emphasis> chapters. Subsections are sections <db:emphasis>inside</db:emphasis> other sections. Where the media domain typically only has before and after relationships (except in tables), the document domain adds inside and outside relationships to the mix. This use of nested, rather than flat, structures helps to create context, which helps to reduce the number of different structures you need. Just as we saw with the basic list structure, nested structures help partition logical document structures.</db:para>
<db:para>Some <db:indexterm><db:primary>document-domain</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>concept</db:primary><db:secondary>document-domain</db:secondary></db:indexterm>document-domain languages are more hierarchical than others. <db:indexterm><db:primary>HTML</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>language</db:primary><db:secondary>HTML</db:secondary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>HTML</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>standard</db:primary><db:secondary>HTML</db:secondary></db:indexterm>HTML is relatively flat. For example, it has six different heading styles <db:indexterm><db:primary>H1</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>structure</db:primary><db:secondary>H1</db:secondary></db:indexterm>H1 through <db:indexterm><db:primary>H6</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>structure</db:primary><db:secondary>H6</db:secondary></db:indexterm>H6. <db:indexterm><db:primary>Docbook</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>language</db:primary><db:secondary>Docbook</db:secondary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>Docbook</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>standard</db:primary><db:secondary>Docbook</db:secondary></db:indexterm>Docbook, a widely used <db:indexterm><db:primary>document-domain</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>concept</db:primary><db:secondary>document-domain</db:secondary></db:indexterm>document-domain structured writing language, is much more hierarchical and has only one element for the same purpose: <db:code>title</db:code>. However, DocBook’s <db:code>title</db:code> element can occur inside 84 different elements and, therefore, can potentially be formatted in 84 different ways based on context. In fact, it can be formatted in more ways than that, since some of the elements that contain titles can also be nested in other elements, creating a hierarchical structure that provides even more contexts.</db:para>
<db:para>There is a balance to be struck here. Hierarchical structures are harder to create and can be harder to understand. They may require you to find just the right place in a hierarchy to insert a new piece of content, which is more difficult than simply starting a new paragraph in a word processor. This introduces complexity, and you need to make sure you don’t introduce more complexity than you take away.</db:para>
</db:section>
<db:section>
<db:title>Constraining document structure</db:title>
<db:para>In addition to factoring out <db:indexterm><db:primary>media domain</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>concept</db:primary><db:secondary>media domain</db:secondary></db:indexterm>media domain constraints, another important reason for working in the <db:indexterm><db:primary>document domain</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>concept</db:primary><db:secondary>document domain</db:secondary></db:indexterm>document domain is to constrain how documents are structured. For example, suppose you want to make sure that all graphics have a figure number, a title, and a caption. In the <db:indexterm><db:primary>media domain</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>concept</db:primary><db:secondary>media domain</db:secondary></db:indexterm>media domain, you can make styles available for figure numbers, titles, and captions, but you can’t enforce a rule that says all graphics must have these elements. In the document domain, you can express these constraints. You can make it illegal to place an image element anywhere in the document structure except within a figure that has a title and caption. A structure to implement this constraint might look like <db:xref linkend="ex.figure-image"/>:</db:para>
<db:figure xml:id="ex.figure-image"><db:title>Document-domain structure for a figure</db:title><db:programlisting language="SAM">
figure:
    title: Cute kitty
    caption: This is a cute kitten.
    image: images/cute.jpg
</db:programlisting></db:figure>
<db:para>If the only way to include an image is to use the image element, and you only allow the image element inside the figure element, and you require the figure element to contain the title and the caption elements, then you can’t add a graphic without a figure, title, and caption. A document without these elements would be rejected by the <db:indexterm><db:primary>conformance algorithm</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>algorithm</db:primary><db:secondary>conformance algorithm</db:secondary></db:indexterm>conformance algorithm (see <db:xref linkend="chapter.conformance"/>).</db:para>
<db:para>This is an example of enforcing a constraint rather than factoring it out. However, it is still a form of partitioning because it constrains where images are allowed, which partitions off design questions about image handling. You still have to decide to use an image, but you only need to make that one decision, after which you have a specific structure that enforces the image constraint.</db:para>
<db:section>
<db:title>HTML and the document domain</db:title>
<db:para>You can see that constraints are important to document-domain languages. Without constraints, it is easy for a language to slip back into the media domain, something that has happened to HTML. Today, structured writing advocates often dismiss HTML as an unstructured language. They compare HTML, unfavorably, to languages such as DocBook or DITA, even though all three are document-domain languages at heart with many similar structures.</db:para>
<db:para>With the advent of CSS, HTML has largely become a set of basic document-domain structures that you can hang styles on. In other words, it is now used much like traditional media-domain word processing and desktop publishing applications, with writers taking back into their own hands formatting decisions that were supposed to be removed from them.</db:para>
<db:para>Why did this happen? When people write in HTML, they largely do so in WYSIWYG environments, using style-oriented tools that closely mimic traditional word processing. In other words, HTML may be a document-domain language, but people commonly create HTML using media-domain tools. The result is often an HTML document that formats more or less correctly but is coded inconsistently, which makes it hard to edit by hand or manipulate with algorithms.</db:para>
</db:section>
</db:section>
<db:section>
<db:title>The size of the document domain</db:title>
<db:para>Another factor in HTML’s slide into the media domain is that it provides only a fairly basic set of document-domain structures. As we have seen, enforcing or factoring out media-domain constraints requires document-domain structures. But the possible list of such structures is quite large. There are a few basic features that are common to all documents, such as paragraphs, lists, and titles. But these structures alone are not enough to hang meaningful and useful document-domain constraints on or to fully partition the content of a document from its formatting.</db:para>
<db:para>Word Processors and Desktop Publishing applications implement a very small subset of potential document domain structures and handle most other things by applying media domain styles to this very limited set of document domain structures. HTML has a few more document domain structures but still relies heavily on styles for many common document constructs. But this approach does not let you factor out media domain concerns or enforce constraints on document structure.</db:para>
<db:para>For example, consider a bibliography. A bibliography is a document structure for listing works cited in a document. It generally consists of the heading “Bibliography” followed by a set of paragraphs listing the cited works. In the media domain, you can easily create such a structure. It is just a sequence of paragraphs with some bold and italic formatting for author names, book titles, etc.</db:para>
<db:para>In your media-domain stylesheet, you may have some character styles for things like <db:code>author-name</db:code> or <db:code>book-title</db:code>. You may even have a paragraph style for bibliography entries, but you typically don’t have much more specific support.</db:para>
<db:para>But these few styles can’t cover all the rules your publisher or organization places on bibliographies. You probably have to follow rules that detail how to handle titles, author names, and so forth. These constraints are not enforced by media-domain styles. You have to learn and follow these constraints for yourself. If you want to remove these decisions from the writer, you need a document-domain structure for a bibliography. <db:indexterm><db:primary>DocBook</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>language</db:primary><db:secondary>DocBook</db:secondary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>DocBook</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>standard</db:primary><db:secondary>DocBook</db:secondary></db:indexterm>DocBook has one (see <db:xref linkend="ex.bib-docbook"/>).</db:para>

<db:para>This structure does not just constrain how bibliography entries are presented and formatted, it also factors out many of those constraints by breaking down the components of a bibliography entry into separate labeled fields. Given a <db:indexterm><db:primary>biblioentry</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>structure</db:primary><db:secondary>biblioentry</db:secondary></db:indexterm>biblioentry structure like this, you could create an algorithm to present and format a bibliography entry almost any way you wanted to. This structure not only partitions the formatting of the bibliography from the presentation of the bibliography, it also partitions the presentation from the underlying bibliographical data. This means you could write an algorithm to extract bibliography information from a document by looking for <db:indexterm><db:primary>biblioentry</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>structure</db:primary><db:secondary>biblioentry</db:secondary></db:indexterm>biblioentry structures and extracting the desired information from them. For instance, if you want to build a list of authors cited in the document, you could do so by searching the <db:indexterm><db:primary>biblioentry</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>structure</db:primary><db:secondary>biblioentry</db:secondary></db:indexterm>biblioentry records and extracting the name of the authors from the structures that record them in the bibliography structure.</db:para>
<db:para>This is very useful, but at the same time there are many such structured in documents and a document domain language the incorporated all of them would be very large and complex – a problem when our core aim is to reduce complexity. To see how we can avoid introducing this level of complexity (and also factor out many document domain constraints), it is time to turn to the subject domain.</db:para>
