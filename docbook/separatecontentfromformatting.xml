<db:para>If there is one phrase that most people associate with structured writing, it is “separating content from formatting”. The is the most basic and well-known form of partitioning and redirecting of complexity that we do in structured writing, and it illustrates the basic method by which we do all the rest. The basic premise of separating content from formatting is to separate decisions about the appearance of a document from decisions about its content. But partitioning content from formatting is not as simple as it may seem. So let’s take a look at it one step at a time.</db:para>
<db:section>
<db:title>Separate out style instructions</db:title>
<db:para>Let’s start with a simple bit of content that includes a description of its format. I’m going to use CSS syntax to describe the format, but that is not significant. This is just to show what we are doing when we do the separation. I’m also going to represents certain characters by their names in square brackets, just so we can see exactly where everything is going:</db:para>
<db:programlisting>
{font: 10pt "Open Sans"}The box contains:
{font: 10pt "Open Sans"}[bullet][tab]Sand
{font: 10pt "Open Sans"}[bullet][tab]Eggs
{font: 10pt "Open Sans"}[bullet][tab]Gold
</db:programlisting>
<db:para>This file contains content and formatting, so let’s separate the two. Of course, when we remove the formatting from the content we are going to have to add something in its place so we can add the formatting back later (partitioning requires passing information between partitions, preferable in-band).</db:para>
<db:para>The simplest thing to replace it with is a style:</db:para>
<db:programlisting>
{style: paragraph}The box contains:
{style: paragraph}[bullet][tab]Sand
{style: paragraph}[bullet][tab]Eggs
{style: paragraph}[bullet][tab]Gold
</db:programlisting>
<db:para>Then, of course, we need to record the style (we are separating it, not eliminating it altogether):</db:para>
<db:programlisting>
paragraph = {font: 10pt "Open Sans"}
</db:programlisting>
<db:para>Now that they are separated, we have the choice of substituting different formatting by changing the definition of the style, while leaving the content alone:</db:para>
<db:programlisting>
paragraph = {font: 12pt "Century Schoolbook"}
</db:programlisting>
</db:section>
<db:section>
<db:title>Separate out formatting characters</db:title>
<db:para>Cool, but suppose we would like to change the style of the bullet we use for lists. The style of bullet used is certainly part of what we would consider “formatting”, but bullets are text characters. To change them you don’t just have to change the font applied to the characters, you have to change the characters themselves.</db:para>
<db:para>Sometimes the typed characters in your text are part of the content, and sometimes they are part of the formatting. So now we need to extend our idea of a style to include characters.</db:para>
<db:programlisting>
paragraph = {font: 12pt "Century Schoolbook"}
bullet-paragraph = {font: 12pt "Century Schoolbook"}[bullet]
</db:programlisting>
<db:para>Now our content looks like this:</db:para>
<db:programlisting>
{style: paragraph}The box contains:
{style: bullet-paragraph}[tab]Sand
{style: bullet-paragraph}[tab]Eggs
{style: bullet-paragraph}[tab]Gold
</db:programlisting>
<db:para>Except that now the writer will be starting the bulleted lines with a tab, which is awkward and probably error prone, so we move that character to the style as well.</db:para>
<db:programlisting>
paragraph = {font: 12pt "Century Schoolbook"}
bullet-paragraph = {font: 12pt "Century Schoolbook"}[bullet][tab]
</db:programlisting>
<db:para>Now our content looks like this:</db:para>
<db:programlisting>
{style: paragraph}The box contains:
{style: bullet-paragraph}Sand
{style: bullet-paragraph}Eggs
{style: bullet-paragraph}Gold
</db:programlisting>
<db:para>And now you can change the bullet style:</db:para>
<db:programlisting>
bullet-paragraph = {font: 12pt "Century Schoolbook"}[em dash][tab]
</db:programlisting>
<db:para>And then we maybe realize that “bullet-paragraph” is not the best name any more, because the style is now a dash, not a bullet. In other words we discover that we had not done as good a job as we thought of partitioning content and formatting, because the content actually still contains formatting information in the form of a style that is named for a particular piece of formatting. In other words, the writer is still making the formatting choice “bullet” when we want them to focus on the content choice “list”.</db:para>
</db:section>
<db:section>
<db:title>Name your abstractions correctly</db:title>
<db:para>When we separate formatting from content, we have to insert something in its place, and it matters what that something is and what it is called. If we call it the wrong thing we set up a false expectation, and that will lead to authors using it incorrectly, which will mean we can’t format it reliably. This is simply poor partitioning.</db:para>
<db:para>So the first lesson about separating content from formatting is that it matters what you call things. You are creating an abstraction, and you need to figure out what that abstraction is and name it appropriately.</db:para>
<db:para>What is the abstraction here? Sand, Eggs, and Gold are list items. So maybe we do this:</db:para>
<db:programlisting>
{style: paragraph}The box contains:
{style: list-item}Sand
{style: list-item}Eggs
{style: list-item}Gold
</db:programlisting>
<db:para>and</db:para>
<db:programlisting>
list-item = {font: 12pt "Century Schoolbook"}[em dash][tab]
</db:programlisting>
</db:section>
<db:section>
<db:title>Make sure you have the right set of abstractions</db:title>
<db:para>But then, of course, we run into this problem:</db:para>
<db:programlisting>
{style: paragraph}To wash hair:
{style: list-item}Lather
{style: list-item}Rinse
{style: list-item}Repeat
</db:programlisting>
<db:para>Here our list should have numbers, not dashes or bullets. So we realize that the abstraction we are after is not so broad as all list items. We look at the differences between the different kinds of list items we use and try to group them into abstract types and come up with names for those types. Maybe we come up with “ordered-list-item” and “unordered-list-item”. Then we have:</db:para>
<db:programlisting>
{style: paragraph}The box contains:
{style: unordered-list-item}Sand
{style: unordered-list-item}Eggs
{style: unordered-list-item}Gold
</db:programlisting>
<db:para>and</db:para>
<db:programlisting>
{style: paragraph}To wash hair:
{style: ordered-list-item}Lather
{style: ordered-list-item}Rinse
{style: ordered-list-item}Repeat
</db:programlisting>
<db:para>And the style for ordered-list-items now looks something like this:</db:para>
<db:programlisting>
ordered-list-item = {font: 12pt "Century Schoolbook"}&lt;count&gt;.[tab]
</db:programlisting>
<db:para>And then we realize that we need a way to increment the count and to reset it to 1 for a new list. So we have:</db:para>
<db:programlisting>
{style: paragraph}To wash hair:
{style: first-ordered-list-item}Lather
{style: ordered-list-item}Rinse
{style: ordered-list-item}Repeat
</db:programlisting>
<db:para>and</db:para>
<db:programlisting>
first-ordered-list-item = 
    {font: 12pt "Century Schoolbook"}&lt;count=1&gt;.[tab]
ordered-list-item = 
    {font: 12pt "Century Schoolbook"}&lt;++count&gt;.[tab]
</db:programlisting>
<db:para>(<db:code>++count</db:code> here means add one to <db:code>count</db:code> and then display it.)</db:para>
<db:para>And this is pretty much how you do lists in <db:indexterm><db:primary>FrameMaker</db:primary></db:indexterm>FrameMaker or <db:indexterm><db:primary>Microsoft Word</db:primary></db:indexterm>Microsoft Word today, as well as a number of other tools. But the reason for going through it in such detail is to point out what is involved in even this simple bit of partitioning. We began by simply removing formatting commands, but then started to remove characters as well, which forced us to include characters in our style definitions, and then to be able to actually calculate characters in our style definitions. And we saw that in performing these separations, we were creating abstractions, and that it was important to consider all the cases we might run into and create the appropriate abstractions to handle them.</db:para>
</db:section>
<db:section>
<db:title>Create containers to provide context</db:title>
<db:para>As we noted in <db:xref linkend="chapter.document-domain"/>, one problem with this approach is that the writer has to remember to apply a different style to the first item of a list. It would be better if they could use the same style for each list item and have the numbering just work. But this is hard to do because there is nothing in the content to say where one numbered list ends and the next begins. For this we need a new abstraction. So far we have abstractions for two kinds of list items: ordered and unordered list items. But we don’t have an abstraction for lists themselves.</db:para>
<db:para>So far, we have been separating content from formatting purely in the <db:indexterm><db:primary>media domain</db:primary></db:indexterm>media domain. We have replaced direct formatting definitions with indirect definitions through styles. The only thing that abstracts any of this beyond the media domain is the names that we have given to the styles that we have created. But now we start to venture into the <db:indexterm><db:primary>document domain</db:primary></db:indexterm>document domain, creating the abstract idea of a list and inserting that abstract idea into our content.</db:para>
<db:programlisting>
paragraph: To wash hair:
list:
    ordered-list-item:Lather
    ordered-list-item:Rinse
    ordered-list-item:Repeat
</db:programlisting>
<db:para>There are a number of significant changes here. First, our structure is no longer flat. We have introduce the idea of a container. A list is a container for list items. In creating this container we have added something to the content that was not there before. Previously it was a series of paragraphs with different styles attached. Now we have a container, which, as far as the formatting is concerned, simply never existed in the original. The writer and reader knew that the sequence of bulleted paragraphs formed a list, but that was an interpretation of the formatting. Now we have taken that interpretation and instantiated it in the content itself. Those lines starting with bullets constitute a list, and now we have made it explicit.</db:para>
<db:para>By creating the idea of a list, we are able to further separate list formatting from the content of the list – because now an algorithm can recognize it as a list and can make formatting decisions based on that knowledge.</db:para>
<db:para>The second important thing that has happened here is that the content no longer contains references to style names. Instead we have structures. <db:code>list</db:code> is a structure and so are <db:code>paragraph</db:code> and <db:code>numbered-list-items</db:code>.</db:para>
<db:para>We have replaced styles with structures because the same structure may get a different style depending on where it is in the document. The <db:indexterm><db:primary>formatting algorithm</db:primary></db:indexterm>formatting algorithm is responsible for determining if an ordered-list-item is the first one inside a list and formatting it accordingly. (Which is just how list formatting works in CSS<db:footnote><db:para>https://css-tricks.com/numbering-in-style/</db:para></db:footnote>.)</db:para>
<db:para>Now authors no longer apply styles to content, even ones with abstract names. Rather they place content in structures and allow the formatting algorithm to apply styles appropriately. The content is  separated even more from the formatting.</db:para>
</db:section>
<db:section>
<db:title>Move the abstractions to the containers</db:title>
<db:para>But there is an obvious problem here. What if an author inadvertently does this:</db:para>
<db:programlisting>
paragraph: To wash hair:
list:
    ordered-list-item:Lather
    unordered-list-item:Rinse
    ordered-list-item:Repeat
</db:programlisting>
<db:para>To avoid this, we move the abstraction outward. Instead of ordered and unordered list items, we create ordered and unordered lists:</db:para>
<db:programlisting>
paragraph: To wash hair:
ordered-list:
    list-item:Lather
    list-item:Rinse
    list-item:Repeat
</db:programlisting>
<db:para>and</db:para>
<db:programlisting>
paragraph: The box contains:
unordered-list:
    list-item:Sand
    list-item:Eggs
    list-item:Gold
</db:programlisting>
<db:para>And, of course, the <db:code>list-item</db:code> structure can be used in either an unordered list or an ordered list, because it is a list item in either case, and the <db:indexterm><db:primary>formatting algorithm</db:primary></db:indexterm>formatting algorithm can tell the difference based on which type of list it belongs to. The name <db:code>list-item</db:code> describes it role in the document in a way that is entirely separated from how it will be styled.</db:para>
<db:para>Moving the abstraction out to the container is an important part of the algorithm of separating content from formatting. It partitions ordered and unordered lists making the construction of each simpler and more reliable. This helps keep things consistent and reduces the number of things authors have to remember. (Notice that this requires the writer to make a decision about whether the list they are writing is ordered or unordered, but that this is a decision they had to make anyway in order to write the content at all – it is implicit in the rhetoric of the piece, we are just asking the writer to make it explicit.)</db:para>
<db:para>Creating containers and abstracting out the differences between their contents is an important piece of separating content for formatting. For example, HTML and Markdown both provide six different level of headings. But content under an <db:code>H2</db:code> or an <db:code>H5</db:code> heading is not in any container. The content simply comes after the heading. This means that is it perfectly possible and legal in these languages to place different heading elements in any order you want. Writers have to make decisions about which heading level they want and how it fits in the structure of the document they are creating.</db:para>
<db:para>By contrast, in <db:indexterm><db:primary>DocBook</db:primary></db:indexterm>DocBook, we have a <db:code>section</db:code> structure. Like a list, a section is part of the writer’s interpretation of what they are creating in the document, but it is only implied, not instantiated by the formatting. The <db:code>section</db:code> structure  instantiates the concept of a section. And once we have the instantiation of a section, we don’t need six levels of heading. We can have one structure called <db:code>title</db:code>. Sections can be nested inside other sections, and the formatting algorithm can apply the correct style to the title based on context:</db:para>
<db:programlisting>
section: 
    title:
    paragraph:
    section:
        title:
</db:programlisting>
<db:para>This will eliminate heading element decisions and therefore incorrect choices, ensuring that the headings in the output consistently reflect the section and subsection structure of the document.</db:para>
<db:para>(It must be said that not everyone holds to the view that headings in a text do or should reflect a hierarchy of sections. Sometimes they may be simply signposts along the way, and like any signpost, the size of the sign reflects the size of the town, not a strict hierarchy of sign sizes. So if that is how you look at document structures, you should choose a different way to separate content from formatting in your content.)</db:para>
</db:section>
<db:section>
<db:title>Separate out abstract formatting</db:title>
<db:para>I noted that in the case of ordered and unordered lists, separating content from formatting actually involves separating out some of the content as well. Or rather, it involves separating out some of the characters. In other words, the distinction between content and formatting is not the same as the distinction between characters and the styles applied to them. Sometimes characters are part of the formatting rather than the content.</db:para>
<db:para>Consider a structure that we might call a labeled list:</db:para>
<db:blockquote>
<db:variablelist>
<db:varlistentry>
<db:term>Street</db:term>
<db:listitem><db:para>123 Elm Street</db:para></db:listitem>
</db:varlistentry>
<db:varlistentry>
<db:term>Town</db:term>
<db:listitem><db:para>Smallville</db:para></db:listitem>
</db:varlistentry>
<db:varlistentry>
<db:term>Country</db:term>
<db:listitem><db:para>USA</db:para></db:listitem>
</db:varlistentry>
<db:varlistentry>
<db:term>Code</db:term>
<db:listitem><db:para>12345</db:para></db:listitem>
</db:varlistentry>
</db:variablelist>
</db:blockquote>
<db:para>The generic structure of a labeled list might look like this:</db:para>
<db:programlisting language="sam">
labeled-list:
    list-item:
        label: Street
        content: 123 Elm Street
    list-item:
        label: Town
        contents: Smallville
    list-item:
        label: Country
        contents: 123 USA
    list-item:
        label: Code
        contents: 12345
</db:programlisting>
<db:para>But what if you have hundreds of addresses, all with the same labels. In this case, are the labels really content, or are they presentation? Since they don’t change from one list to another, we could look at them as being part of how the content is presented, rather than being part of the content itself. So we look for a way to separate them from the content.</db:para>
<db:para>As always, when we separate something from our content, we have to replace it with something else. In this case, it is named structures that reflect the actual subject matter of the entries:</db:para>
<db:programlisting language="sam">
address:
    street: 123 Elm Street
    town: Smallville
    country: USA
    code: 12345
</db:programlisting>
<db:para>Now, of course, we have moved our content into the <db:indexterm><db:primary>subject domain</db:primary></db:indexterm>subject domain. At this point we should make a distinction between formatting and presentation. Though these two words are often used interchangeably, we need to make a distinction between them for structured writing purposes. For purposes of this discussion, the formatting of text is the precise details of its appearance: the font chosen, the width of the text column, the size of the characters, the spacing between line, the size and shape of the bullet characters.</db:para>
<db:para>Presentation, on the other hand, is about how we organize the content. Deciding to use a list to present a certain piece of information is a presentation decision, and it is independent of the formatting details we apply to lists. When we move content from the <db:indexterm><db:primary>media domain</db:primary></db:indexterm>media domain to the <db:indexterm><db:primary>document domain</db:primary></db:indexterm>document domain, we separate the formatting of the content from the presentation of the content. The decision to present the information as a list remains; the decision about what that list will look like has been separated out.</db:para>
<db:para>When we move the content from the <db:indexterm><db:primary>document domain</db:primary></db:indexterm>document domain to the <db:indexterm><db:primary>subject domain</db:primary></db:indexterm>subject domain, however, we separate the information from the presentation. The subject domain structure above is not a labeled list. It is a data record that could be turned into many different forms of presentation.</db:para>
<db:para>The job of turning such structures into a specific form of presentation is the job of the presentation algorithm, which we will look at in more detail in <db:xref linkend="chapter.publishing"/>. The presentation algorithm could turn it into a labeled list, a table, a paragraph (with the fields separated by commas), or the address label for an envelope.</db:para>
<db:para>In the <db:indexterm><db:primary>subject domain</db:primary></db:indexterm>subject domain, with the content separated from both formatting and presentation, we also gain the ability to query and reorganize the content in various interesting and useful ways (which we will explore in later chapters).</db:para>
<db:para>This is as far as we can go in separating content from formatting, and we can’t separate all content from formatting to quite this extent. It should be clear at this point that separating content from format is not a binary thing. There are various stages of separation that we can achieve for various reasons. It is important to understand exactly which degree of separation will best serve your needs.</db:para>
