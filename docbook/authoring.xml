<db:para>Most of the complexity of the content process flows through the writer. Before computers, the writer prepared a typescript that was handed off to other people to manipulate before the work was eventually set in type and printed. Today, we generally expect that the writer will be the last person to manipulate content. Everything after that will be handled by an algorithm. The writer must supply everything the publishing process needs. Making that task manageable for writers is key to successfully partitioning your content system.</db:para>
<db:para>But the complexity imposed by publishing and content management functions is not the only source of complexity that writers must deal with. They must also develop the best rhetorical strategy for a given subject matter, apply that strategy consistently, and work effectively with other writers to achieve the overall content strategy of the organization. These factors are major sources of complexity, and all that complexity flows through the writer as well.</db:para>
<db:section>
<db:title>Constraints versus usability</db:title>
<db:para>If we are going to partition the content system to relieve writers of as many extended decisions as possible, we need to create structures that effectively direct those decisions away from them. But we can’t do this by creating a loose unconstrained environment for writers. If we don’t get a high level of conformance to specific content structures, our algorithms will not be reliable, the partitioning will break down, and the complexity will fall back on the writers or down to the readers. The structures we present to writers must combine strict conformance with ease of use.</db:para>
<db:para>In media-domain systems, such as word processors and desktop publishing systems, writers must make decisions about formatting while writing. One of the traditional arguments for structured writing is that it relieves writers of the burden of making and executing formatting decisions, so they can focus on writing. This means moving to the document domain. But in the document domain, writers have a new set of structures to think about. Is it easier for writers to think about and manipulate document-domain structures rather than media-domain structures? In some cases, yes. For instance, writing a blog post or a web page in <db:indexterm><db:primary>Markdown</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>language</db:primary><db:secondary>Markdown</db:secondary></db:indexterm>Markdown may be less cumbersome for some writers than using a <db:indexterm><db:primary>WYSIWYG</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>concept</db:primary><db:secondary>WYSIWYG</db:secondary></db:indexterm>WYSIWYG <db:indexterm><db:primary>HTML</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>language</db:primary><db:secondary>HTML</db:secondary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>HTML</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>standard</db:primary><db:secondary>HTML</db:secondary></db:indexterm>HTML editor.</db:para>
<db:para>However, <db:indexterm><db:primary>Markdown</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>language</db:primary><db:secondary>Markdown</db:secondary></db:indexterm>Markdown does not contain enough structure – or enough constraints on its structure – to enable many of the structured writing algorithms we will be looking at. If we want to support these algorithms, we need something more structured.</db:para>
<db:para>If we want to implement management-intensive algorithms such as <db:indexterm><db:primary>content reuse algorithm</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>algorithm</db:primary><db:secondary>content reuse algorithm</db:secondary></db:indexterm>content reuse, writers may need to learn how to manipulate a content management system and the management policies that go with one. Depending on how complex these policies are and how foreign they are to the writer’s experience, this can create a far greater burden than formatting content according to a style guide.</db:para>
<db:para>We could look at this and say, yes, this additional structure has made writing more difficult and complex than it was before. However, we are gaining advantages as well, such as reuse and content management. The problem is, attention is a finite resource. Writing takes full attention, and added decision making takes attention away from writing and requires more knowledge and skill from the writer. As writing get more difficult, writers handle each component task less well. In addition, it becomes harder to find writers who have the necessary skills to work in a more complex environment. The more attention writers must spend on structure, the less they have available for writing, and the quality of their writing suffers.</db:para>
<db:para>As writing quality suffers, writers become frustrated with the system, and, in order to focus their attention on content, they start to ignore the onerous structural rules that are getting in their way. When that happens, the quality of the structure suffers as well. And if the quality of both the writing and the structure declines, your algorithms become less reliable, compromising all of benefits you hoped to obtain. Too much complexity dumped on any one person or process compromises all downstream persons and processes.</db:para>
<db:para>Conformance is fundamentally a human activity. It is writers who must conform, and they conform best when you create structures that are easy to conform to. It all begins with writing. Unfortunately, writing is often the last thing people think about when designing content management and structured writing systems. Yet, writing is where complexity gets dumped before it eventually gets dumped on readers.</db:para>
<db:para>One of the most familiar tropes of the content management industry is that problems with content management systems are not technology problems, they are human problems. The solution, this trope suggests, lies in better change management and more training. The presumption here is that the tools work fine if you give them correct input. If the input is not correct, that is the fault of the humans who created the input.</db:para>
<db:para>We would not accept this argument for any other kind of system. For any other kind of system we would say, “this system is too hard to use,”, not “the problem is that everybody needs to be better trained and more accepting of change.” The real fault here is poor system design. If humans cannot conform to the structures the system requires, the fault is in the system design. If the system doesn’t partition and distribute complexity correctly, the structures need to be redesigned so humans can conform to them. (We look at this in more detail in <db:xref linkend="chapter.conformance"/>.)</db:para>
<db:para>How do we design structures that are easy to use but still provide the constraints we need for quality and efficiency? As we have seen, moving from the <db:indexterm><db:primary>media domain</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>concept</db:primary><db:secondary>media domain</db:secondary></db:indexterm>media domain to the <db:indexterm><db:primary>document domain</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>concept</db:primary><db:secondary>document domain</db:secondary></db:indexterm>document domain allows us to factor out or impose certain structural constraints, but to do so, we often must introduce the management domain to impose content management constraints. This added complexity detracts from ease of writing. However, we have also seen that moving to the subject domain allows us to factor out many of the document-domain and management-domain structures. Designing structures for writing, therefore, often consists of factoring out complex publishing and content management structures using subject-domain structures that are lucid for writers.</db:para>
<db:para>One of the most important consequences of this, both for ease of writing and reliability of data, is that in the subject domain you don’t ask writers to think, decide, and structure content in terms of algorithms. In this sense, the move to the subject domain not only factors out specific constraints from writers, it factors out the need for writers to think in algorithms at all, leaving them free to think and decide in terms of subject matter. This freedom to focus on content is a property I call <db:emphasis>functional lucidity</db:emphasis>.</db:para>

<db:section>
<db:title>Functional lucidity</db:title>
<db:para>Functional lucidity refers to the total intellectual burden that a system imposes on writers: how clearly do they understand what the system requires and how fluidly and naturally can they create structures and content in that system. The functional lucidity of a markup language is not a matter of its size or its complexity. It is a matter of how natural and obvious it is for writers to use and how well the markup language aligns with a writer’s core decisions, the decisions that are essential to the task, as opposed to extended decisions, which are external to it.</db:para>
<db:para>If you have ever tried to learn a language, you know how painful it is to write even a paragraph in a language you are not fluent in. The effort of finding words and correct grammatical structures takes all of the attention that should be reserved for what you are trying to say. Writing in a markup language where the structures don’t make intuitive sense, where they don’t seem to fit the thoughts you are trying to express, where they require knowledge and skills external to your core task, is very much like this. Lucidity is essential to avoid having the markup absorb all of the attention that should be focused on the content.</db:para>
<db:para>There is a bit of a catch to functional lucidity, however. Many professional writers, particularly technical writers, are so used to making extended decisions that they find it disconcerting, at least at first, to use a system that removes those decisions from them. Thus, writers currently using a complicated <db:indexterm><db:primary>document-domain</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>concept</db:primary><db:secondary>document-domain</db:secondary></db:indexterm>document-domain tool such as FrameMaker may feel more comfortable switching to an equally complicated <db:indexterm><db:primary>document-domain</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>concept</db:primary><db:secondary>document-domain</db:secondary></db:indexterm>document-domain markup language like <db:indexterm><db:primary>DocBook</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>language</db:primary><db:secondary>DocBook</db:secondary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>DocBook</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>standard</db:primary><db:secondary>DocBook</db:secondary></db:indexterm>DocBook, since it involves most of the same extended decisions they were making before. On the other hand, writers who are not used to making those decisions will find neither <db:indexterm><db:primary>FrameMaker</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>tool</db:primary><db:secondary>FrameMaker</db:secondary></db:indexterm>FrameMaker nor <db:indexterm><db:primary>DocBook</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>language</db:primary><db:secondary>DocBook</db:secondary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>DocBook</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>standard</db:primary><db:secondary>DocBook</db:secondary></db:indexterm>DocBook to be functionally lucid.</db:para>
<db:para>Writers’ initial impressions of the functional lucidity of a tool or markup language are often based on how well the extended decisions required by the new tool align with those required by the old tool, rather than on how well the language aligns with their core decisions. Their old tools have created a silo in the mind that leads them to expect a new tool to present the same extended decisions as the old tool.</db:para>
<db:para>However, remember that the aim in adopting structured writing is to handle elements of complexity that we are not currently handling well. Thus, we need to assess the functional lucidity of any proposed system based on a long-term view of how the new system partitions complexity, not on a short-term view of how familiar the structures are to writers based on their current tools. A well-designed <db:indexterm><db:primary>subject-domain</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>concept</db:primary><db:secondary>subject-domain</db:secondary></db:indexterm>subject-domain language will be functionally lucid for writers who are familiar with the subject matter, even if they have to get used to no longer making the extended decisions required by their old tools. Writers will get over their attachment to the old tools if the new tools produce superior results.</db:para>

<db:section>
<db:title>Simplicity and Clarity</db:title>
<db:para>One of the biggest benefits of subject-domain markup for writers is a much higher degree of functional lucidity compared with a typical document-domain language.</db:para>
<db:para>While a document domain-language such as <db:indexterm><db:primary>DocBook</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>language</db:primary><db:secondary>DocBook</db:secondary></db:indexterm>DocBook must have a wide range of document structures, a recipe markup language such as the one we developed in <db:xref linkend="chapter.subject-domain"/> has only a few simple structures. Better still, there are very few permutations of those structures. The decisions writers must make align closely with the core task of expressing the method for preparing a dish.</db:para>
<db:para>Because subject-domain structures describe the subject matter they contain, they are also much clearer to writers, who may not understand complex document structures (or, more often, the subtle distinctions between several similar document structures), but who do (we hope) understand their subject matter.</db:para>

<db:para>The combination of simplicity and clarity means that writers can often create subject-domain structured content with little or no training. For instance, even if we add some additional fields to our recipe markup, a writer could easily use a sample like the one in <db:xref linkend="ex.authoring-recipe"/> as a template without any training or special tools.</db:para>
<db:para>Of course, the downside is that recipe markup is good for only one thing: recipes. Complexity is never destroyed, only moved somewhere else. So this approach moves complexity away from the writer to the person who has to design and maintain these structures and the algorithms that process them. (<db:indexterm><db:primary>Information Architect</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>role</db:primary><db:secondary>Information Architect</db:secondary></db:indexterm>Information Architect and <db:indexterm><db:primary>Content Engineer</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>role</db:primary><db:secondary>Content Engineer</db:secondary></db:indexterm>Content Engineer are both titles sometimes used for the person with this responsibility.)</db:para>
<db:para>This can seem scary because we are not used to partitioning complexity in this way. But then, the way we have partitioned complexity in the past has not been as successful as we would like – it has, in fact, left much of the complexity of content creation unhandled, resulting in that complexity being dumped on our readers. A new partitioning of the content creation process requires us to accept that some of these new methods of partitioning will be unfamiliar.</db:para>
