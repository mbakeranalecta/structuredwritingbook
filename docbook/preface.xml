<db:title>The Complexity of the Content Process</db:title>

<db:para>You have to create good consistent letter shapes with your pen.</db:para>
</db:listitem>
</db:itemizedlist>
<db:para>Okay, we haven’t had to deal with that last one for a while now. But something has to create letter shapes, line them up nicely, and fit them within the margins. Before we had machines to do it for us, that task was part of the writer’s life and an essential skill if you wanted to create a readable document. And if you wanted more than one copy, you had to write out each copy by hand or hire copyists to do it for you.</db:para>
<db:para>Fortunately, Gutenberg invented a machine that took that burden off the writer’s hands, making the writer’s life easier. The printing press allowed people who were not trained in calligraphy to become writers. It also put a lot of copyists out of business. (Yes, the loss of white-collar jobs to automation is not a new thing.) But it also made books much cheaper, revolutionizing civilization and creating many more white-collar jobs.</db:para>
<db:para>The printing press partitioned the task of language composition from the task of physical book making. Of course, the writer’s handwriting still had to be good enough for the printer to read. But then came the typewriter, the computer keyboard, and the touch screen with predictive typing, and now many children are not even being taught cursive writing in school. Lament the withering of handwriting skills if you like, but it represents a new partitioning of the writing process, one in which manipulating a pen and shaping letters has been entirely partitioned from the writer.</db:para>
<db:para>Of course, this introduces a new skill that the writer has to master: typing. When a task is partitioned, there is always a new skill to learn. Partitioning a task creates the need to transmit information from one partition to another. The typewriter (or, today, the computer and monitor) take over the task of forming letters on paper or screen, but they need to know which letters the writer wants. The writer tells them by tapping keys on the keyboard. The keys are the interface between the partitions of the writing process. Using the new interfaces is part of the adaptation to working in the newly partitioned system.</db:para>
<db:para>Of course, there is far more to content development and delivery than forming consistent letter shapes and making copies quickly. Every content organization partitions and distributes content creation. Newspapers do not make reporters drive delivery trucks. Publishing houses do not let authors design book covers (much as they might want to). Recognizing that spotting your own mistakes is difficult, wise organizations partition the job of editing and proofreading content from the job of writing it. When they need to orchestrate a large body of content to the Web, organizations employ <db:indexterm><db:primary>information architects</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>role</db:primary><db:secondary>information architects</db:secondary></db:indexterm>information architects and <db:indexterm><db:primary>content strategists</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>role</db:primary><db:secondary>content strategists</db:secondary></db:indexterm>content strategists. All of these examples partition the complexity of the content process to improve quality and efficiency. Partitioning a modern content process is complex, often involving multiple partitions with multiple complex interfaces.</db:para>
<db:para>There are two potential benefits to partitioning the content process. First, it can make the writer’s job easier, meaning that more people can write, and writers can focus more attention on subject matter and rhetoric and less on the tools. Second, you can improve efficiency by assigning partitioned tasks to people or processes better equipped to handle them. A typewriter or a computer makes much more consistent letter shapes than a human hand. The printing press makes identical copies much faster than a human copyist.</db:para>

<db:para>You can’t reduce the fundamental complexity of content creation.</db:para>
</db:sidebar>
<db:para>You can’t reduce the fundamental complexity of content creation. All that stuff has to get done, and it is all difficult in one way or another. Different tasks require different skills and knowledge. Writing alone – figuring out what to say and how best to say it – is a complex task that deserves the writer’s whole attention. You cannot eliminate the complexity of everything that goes on around the writing task, but you can make sure that it is partitioned and directed to people or processes that are best equipped to deal with it.</db:para>
<db:para>What happens if you don’t manage the inherent complexity of content creation properly? Complexity cannot be destroyed. It has to go somewhere. If no one in your organization handles it, it falls through to your readers. If your content lacks needed information, the burden of finding that information falls on your readers. If your readers can’t understand the terms used, read the font chosen, find content to explain an unfamiliar concept, get the information they need when they need it, or tell current information from outdated, that complexity falls on them. They must then either handle the complexity themselves or abandon the content.</db:para>
<db:para>Another name for this is poor content quality. Poor content quality is the direct result of the complexity of content creation falling through to the reader instead of being handled in the organization that produced it. To consistently create quality, you must ensure that every piece of the inherent complexity of content creation is directed to a competent and adequately resourced person or process.</db:para>
<db:para>There are only five reasons for an organization to create content:</db:para>
<db:itemizedlist>
<db:listitem>
<db:para>To meet regulatory requirements</db:para>
</db:listitem>
<db:listitem>
<db:para>To ensure the correct performance of internal processes</db:para>
</db:listitem>
<db:listitem>
<db:para>To generate leads and support the sales process</db:para>
</db:listitem>
<db:listitem>
<db:para>To lobby governments and affect social and political trends</db:para>
</db:listitem>
<db:listitem>
<db:para>To improve customer retention through post-sales support</db:para>
</db:listitem>
</db:itemizedlist>
<db:para>Each of these goes straight to the bottom line of revenue and profitability, and each depends directly on the quality of content. To create a content process with any goal in mind other than to maximize content quality is foolish, shortsighted, and almost certainly guaranteed to have negative effects on revenue and profitability even if it reduces costs in a particular division.</db:para>
<db:remark>MB - 
I think it is important to emphasize what bottom line we are talking about here. Thus I have restored “of revenue and profitability”.
</db:remark>
<db:remark>MB - 
The transition to talking about “the structured writing spectrum” seemed to abrupt here, and, as you point out, it introduced a definition of structured writing that was out of sync with a definition given later. So I have rewritten the whole section.
</db:remark>
<db:para>You partition any process by imposing structure. Structure is what defines the boundaries of the partitions and ensures that communication and coordination between the partitions works effectively and efficiently. Thus we may understand structured writing broadly to be the creation of structures that allow us to partition the content creation process.</db:para>
<db:para>Since all writing tools more sophisticated than pen and ink partition the writing process in some way, all such tools are, in this sense, structured writing tools. Today we tend to use the term structured writing in a more restricted sense, largely to refer to writing tools and processes based on <db:indexterm><db:primary>markup languages</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>tool</db:primary><db:secondary>markup languages</db:secondary></db:indexterm>markup languages. But as this book will show, the fundamental principles and processes of structured writing are present in all modern writing tools. The virtue of markup-based solutions is not that they do something fundamentally different, but that they offer a greater flexibility in creating structures, and therefore provide greater flexibility to optimally partition your content process.</db:para>
<db:para>Every organization’s content tools are structured. Every organization’s content processes are partitioned. But in many organizations, the current tools and processes fail to assign each part of the complexity of content creation to the person or process with the best combination of skills, time, and resources to handle it. The result is poor content quality and a reduction in revenue and profitability. The cure is to adopt a partitioning that better handles the complexity the organization is experiencing.</db:para>
<db:para>Different partitioning demands different structures. This books aims to show how different approaches to structured writing can be used to change how your content processes are partitioned, allowing you to design a content system that is optimally partitioned of your organization’s needs.</db:para>
<db:para>Different organizations benefit from different partitioning of the content system, therefore this book does not advocate for any one system. Nor can it tell you exactly which combination of techniques and tools is right for your organization. Each organization has a unique set of needs, and finding the right combination of techniques to meet those needs is something only you can do. Hopefully, though, this book can help you determine which techniques will work best for your organization, whether that means adopting or adapting an existing system or building a system for yourself.</db:para>
