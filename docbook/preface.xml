<db:title>The Complexity of the Content Process</db:title>


<db:para>Creating content is a complex business.</db:para>

<db:para>You have to research your subject matter and your audience.</db:para>

<db:para>You then have to record the content, manage it, and publish it, potentially to many different audiences and many different media.</db:para>

<db:para>As your subject matter and your business needs change, you need to figure out how your content needs to change and implement those changes cleanly and efficiently.</db:para>

<db:para>You have to create good consistent letter shapes with your pen.</db:para>
</db:listitem>
</db:itemizedlist>
<db:para>Okay, we haven’t had to deal with that last one for a while now. But something has to create letter shapes, line them up nicely, and fit them within the margins. Before we had machines to do it for us, that task was part of the writer’s life and an essential skill if you wanted to create a readable document. And if you wanted more than one copy, you had to write out each copy by hand or hire copyists to do it for you.</db:para>
<db:para>Fortunately, Gutenberg invented a machine that took that burden off the writer’s hands, making the writer’s life easier. The printing press allowed people who were not trained in calligraphy to become writers. It also put a lot of copyists out of business. (Yes, the loss of white-collar jobs to automation is not a new thing.) But it also made books much cheaper, revolutionizing civilization and creating many more white-collar jobs.</db:para>
<db:para>The printing press partitioned the task of language composition from the task of physical book making. Of course, the writer’s handwriting still had to be good enough for the printer to read. But then came the typewriter, the computer keyboard, and the touch screen with predictive typing, and now many children are not even being taught cursive writing in school. Lament the withering of handwriting skills if you like, but it represents a new partitioning of the writing process, one in which manipulating a pen and shaping letters has been entirely partitioned from the writer.</db:para>
<db:para>Of course, this introduces a new skill to master: typing. When you partition a task, you always have a new skill to learn, because you need to transmit information from one partition to another. In this case, a device – a typewriter or, today, a computer and monitor – takes over the task of forming letters on paper or screen, but you still need to tell the device which letters you want to appear, typically by tapping keys on the keyboard. The keys are the interface between the partitions of the writing process. Using new interfaces is part of adapting to the newly partitioned system.</db:para>
<db:para>Of course, there is far more to content development and delivery than forming consistent letter shapes and making copies quickly. Every content organization partitions and distributes content creation. Newspapers do not make reporters drive delivery trucks. Publishing houses do not let authors design book covers (much as they might want to). Recognizing that spotting your own mistakes is difficult, wise organizations partition the job of editing and proofreading content from the job of writing it. When they need to orchestrate a large body of content to the Web, organizations employ information architects and content strategists. All of these examples partition the complexity of the content process to improve quality and efficiency. Partitioning a modern content process is complex, often involving multiple partitions with multiple complex interfaces.</db:para>
<db:para>There are two potential benefits to partitioning the content process. First, it can make the writer’s job easier, meaning that more people can write, and writers can focus more attention on the subject matter and less on the tools. Second, you can improve efficiency by assigning partitioned tasks to people or processes better equipped to handle them. A typewriter or a computer makes much more consistent letter shapes than a human hand. The printing press makes identical copies much faster than a human copyist.</db:para>

<db:para>You can’t reduce the fundamental complexity of content creation.</db:para>
</db:sidebar>
<db:para>You can’t reduce the fundamental complexity of content creation. All that stuff has to get done, and it is all difficult in one way or another. Different tasks require different skills and knowledge. Writing alone – figuring out what to say and how best to say it – is a complex task that deserves your whole attention. You cannot eliminate the complexity of everything that goes on around the writing task, but you can make sure that it is partitioned and directed to people or processes that are best equipped to deal with it.</db:para>
<db:para>What happens if you don’t manage the inherent complexity of content creation properly? Complexity cannot be destroyed. It has to go somewhere. If no one in your organization handles it, it falls through to your readers. If your content lacks needed information, the burden of finding that information falls on your readers. If your readers can’t understand the terms used, read the font chosen, find content to explain an unfamiliar concept, get the information they need when they need it, or tell current information from outdated, that complexity falls on them. They must then either handle the complexity themselves or abandon the content.</db:para>
<db:para>Another name for this is poor content quality. Poor content quality is the direct result of complexity falling through to the reader instead of being handled in the organization that produced it. To consistently create quality, you must ensure that every piece of the inherent complexity of content creation is directed to a competent and adequately resourced person or process.</db:para>
<db:para>There are only five reasons for an organization to create content:</db:para>
<db:itemizedlist>
<db:listitem>
<db:para>To meet regulatory requirements</db:para>
</db:listitem>
<db:listitem>
<db:para>To ensure the correct performance of internal processes</db:para>
</db:listitem>
<db:listitem>
<db:para>To generate leads and support the sales process</db:para>
</db:listitem>
<db:listitem>
<db:para>To lobby governments and affect social and political trends</db:para>
</db:listitem>
<db:listitem>
<db:para>To improve customer retention through post-sales support</db:para>
</db:listitem>
</db:itemizedlist>
<db:para>Each of these goes straight to the bottom line, and each depends on the quality of content. To create a content process with any goal in mind other than to maximize content quality is foolish, shortsighted, and almost certainly guaranteed to have negative effects on revenue and profitability, even if it reduces costs in a particular division.</db:para>
<db:para>Every tool used to create and deliver content falls somewhere on the structured-writing spectrum. Each uses content structures to partition the complexity of the content process. But in many organizations, the current tools and practices fail to assign each part of this complexity to the person or process with the best combination of skills, time, and resources to handle that part. The result is poor content quality and a reduction in revenue and profitability. The cure is to adopt a partitioning that better handles the complexity the organization is experiencing. Structured writing provides the tools to do that partitioning.</db:para>

<db:para>Structured writing is a methodology for preparing content for algorithms.</db:para>
</db:sidebar>
<db:para>Every writing tool uses <db:indexterm><db:primary>algorithm</db:primary></db:indexterm><db:indexterm><db:primary>concept</db:primary><db:secondary>algorithm</db:secondary></db:indexterm>algorithms to process content. Structured writing is a methodology for preparing content for algorithms. When you partition a content system with tools, you are partitioning parts of the complexity of content creation to algorithms. Structured writing techniques give you the highest degree of control over the algorithms you use, and thus the greatest control over how your content process is partitioned, which in turn gives you the greatest control over your content quality.</db:para>
<db:para>This book describes the principal structured writing algorithms and the structures that support them. It begins by looking at the concept of partitioning the content process and the three (plus one) structured writing domains. This sets the groundwork for a review of all the major structured-content algorithms. It concludes with a look at content structures and the decision making process for partitioning your content system.</db:para>
<db:para>Different organizations benefit from different partitioning of the content system, therefore this book does not advocate for any one system. Nor can it tell you exactly which combination of techniques and tools is right for your organization. Each organization has a unique set of need,, and finding the right combination of techniques to meet those needs is something only you can do. Hopefully, though, this book can help you determine which techniques will work best for your organization, whether that means adopting or adapting an existing system or building a system for yourself.</db:para>
