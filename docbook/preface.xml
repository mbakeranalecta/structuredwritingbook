<db:title>The Complexity of the Content Process</db:title>


<db:para>Creating content is a complex business.</db:para>
<db:itemizedlist>
<db:listitem>
<db:para>You have to research your subject matter and your audience.</db:para>
</db:listitem>
<db:listitem>
<db:para>You have to figure out what needs to be said and how to say it to achieve your desired effect.</db:para>
</db:listitem>
<db:listitem>
<db:para>You then have to record the content, manage it, and publish it, potentially to many different audiences and many different media.</db:para>
</db:listitem>
<db:listitem>
<db:para>If you are part of an organization that creates a lot of content, you have to coordinate what you are doing with what everyone else in doing and make sure it all works together and serves the organization’s goals.</db:para>
</db:listitem>
<db:listitem>
<db:para>As your subject matter and your business needs change over time, you need to figure out how your content needs to change and implement all those changes cleanly and efficiently.</db:para>
</db:listitem>
<db:listitem>
<db:para>You have to create good consistent letter shapes with your pen.</db:para>
</db:listitem>
</db:itemizedlist>
<db:para>Okay, we haven’t had to deal with that last one for a while now. But something has to create letter shapes, line them up nicely, and fit them between the margins. Before we had machines to do it for us, that task was part of the writer’s life, and an essential skill if you wanted to create a readable document. And if you wanted more than one copy, you had to write out each copy by hand, or hire some copyists to do it for you.</db:para>
<db:para>Fortunately, Gutenberg invented a machine that took that burden off the writer’s hands. This made the writer’s life easier. It allowed people who were not trained in calligraphy to become writers. It also put a lot of copyists out of business. (Yes, the loss of white-collar jobs to automation is not a new thing.) But it also made the making of books so much cheaper that it revolutionized a civilization (and created a whole bunch more white collar jobs).</db:para>
<db:para>What the printing press did was to partition partitioning the task of language composition from the task of physical book making. Of course, the writer’s handwriting still had to be good enough for the printer to read. But then came the typewriter, and the computer keyboard, and the touch screen with predictive typing, and now many children are not even being taught cursive writing in school. Lament the withering of the skill if you like, but it represents a new partitioning of the writing process, one in which the physical manipulation of the pen and the shaping of letters has been entirely partitioned from the writer.</db:para>
<db:para>Of course, this introduces a new skill that the writer has to master: typing. When a task is partitioned, there is always a new skill to learn. Partitioning a task creates the need to transmit information from one partition to another. The typewriter (or, today, the computer and monitor) take over the task of forming letters on paper or screen, but they need to know which letters you want to appear. You tell them by tapping keys on the keyboard. The keys are the interface between the partitions of the writing process. Using the new interfaces is part of the adaptation to working in the newly partitioned system.</db:para>
<db:para>Of course, there is far more to the total content development and delivery process than forming consistent letter shapes and making copies quickly. Every content organization practices the partitioning and distribution of content creation. Newspapers do not make reporters drive the delivery trucks. Publishing houses do not let authors design book covers (much as they might want to). Recognizing that spotting your own mistakes is difficult, wise organizations partition the job of editing and proofreading content from the job of writing it. When they need to orchestrate a large body of content to the Web, organizations employ information architects and content strategists. All of these are examples of partitioning the complexity of the content process with the goal of improving quality and efficiency. The partitioning of a modern content process is complex, often involving multiple partitions with multiple complex interfaces.</db:para>
<db:para>There are two potential benefits to partitioning the content process. The first is that it can make the writer’s job easier, meaning that more people can write and the more of the writer’s attention can be on their subject matter and the words they choose to express it, and less on their tools. The second is that it can make the part of the task that has been partitioned off faster and more efficient by directing it to a person or process better equipped to handle it. A typewriter or a computer makes much more consistent letter shapes than a human hand. The printing press makes identical copies much faster than a human copyist.</db:para>
<db:para>You can’t reduce the fundamental complexity of content creation. All that stuff has to get done, and it is all difficult in one way or another. Different tasks require different skills and knowledge. Writing alone – figuring out what to say and how best to say it – is a complex task that deserves the writer’s whole attention. You cannot eliminate the complexity of everything that goes on around the writing task, but you can make sure that it is partitioned and directed to people or processes that are best equipped to deal with it.</db:para>
<db:para>What happens if the inherent complexity of content creation is not managed properly? Complexity cannot be destroyed. It has to go somewhere. If no one in the publishing organization handles it, it falls through to the reader. If a piece of content is missing information the reader needs, then the burden of finding the missing information falls on the reader. If the reader can’t understand the terms used, or read the font chosen, or find content to explain an unfamiliar concept, or get the information they need when they need it, or tell current information from outdated, that is complexity falling through the content creation process to land on the reader’s head. The reader must then either handle the complexity themselves or abandon the content.</db:para>
<db:para>Another name for this is poor quality content. Poor content quality is the direct result of the complexity of content creation falling through to the reader instead of being handled in the organization that produced it. The way for an organization to consistently create quality content is to make sure that every piece of the inherent complexity of content creation is directed to a competent and adequately resourced person or process so that none of it falls through to the reader.</db:para>
<db:para>There are only four reasons for an organization to create content:</db:para>
<db:itemizedlist>
<db:listitem>
<db:para>To meet regulatory requirements</db:para>
</db:listitem>
<db:listitem>
<db:para>To ensure the correct performance of internal processes</db:para>
</db:listitem>
<db:listitem>
<db:para>To generate leads and support the sales process</db:para>
</db:listitem>
<db:listitem>
<db:para>To improve customer retention through post-sales support</db:para>
</db:listitem>
</db:itemizedlist>
<db:para>Each of these goes straight to the bottom line of revenue and profitability, and each depends directly on the quality of content. To create a content process with any goal in mind other than to maximize content quality is foolish, shortsighted, and almost certainly guaranteed to have negative effects on revenue and profitability (even if it reduces costs in a particular division).</db:para>
<db:para>All the tools that organizations use to create and deliver content fall somewhere on the structured writing spectrum. All of them use content structures to partition the complexity of the content process in one way or another. But in many organizations, the partitioning provided by their current tools and practices is not ensuring the every part of the complexity of the content system is being handled by a person or process with the skills, time, and resources to handle it. The result is poor content quality and a resulting reduction in revenue and profitability. The cure is to adopt a different partitioning of the content system that better handles the complexity the organization is experiencing. Structured writing provides the tools to do that partitioning.</db:para>
<db:para>This book seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of how different structured writing techniques can be used to partition and distribute the complexity of content creation. It does not advocate for any one system. Nor will it tell you exactly which combination of techniques and tools will be right for your organization. Different organizations have different kinds of complexity to deal with and need to distribute it in different ways to maximize the quality of the content they produce. Finding the right combination of techniques for your organization is up to you. Hopefully, though, this book will give your the information you need to figure out what will work best, whether that means adopting or adapting an existing system or building all or part of a system for yourself.</db:para>
