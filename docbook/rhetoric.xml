<db:para>The purpose of the content process is to produce good rhetoric. In <db:xref linkend="part.domains"/> we saw how structured writing can enforce of factor out certain rhetorical rules in your content and hinted at how it can be used to improve process.

<db:para>Rhetoric is not just about how individual documents do their jobs, however. Documents are just elements of a larger information set that serves a multitude of complex information needs. The organization of that larger information set is the domain of information architecture. Information architecture is a part of rhetoric, and the rhetoric of the information architecture can have a direct impact on the rhetoric of individual documents. Thus this part takes a look at information architecture and the relationship between the rhetoric of documents and the rhetoric of information sets.</db:para>
<db:para>Finally, rhetoric is, ultimately, the domain of the writer. Rhetoric is what writers do. Structured writing does not usurp the writerâ€™s role in rhetoric. Rather, structured writing is a tool for writers to use to exercise their function as creators of rhetoric with greater precision and consistency. Thus this part concludes with a look at how a structured approach to rhetoric fits into the writing process.</db:para>
